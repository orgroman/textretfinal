# Pyserini: A Conceptual Framework for Retrieval

This guide presents a conceptual framework for a representational approach to information retrieval that integrates dense and sparse representations into the same underlying (bi-encoder) architecture.

If you're a Waterloo student traversing the [onboarding path](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ura.md),
make sure you've first done all the exercises leading up to this guide, starting [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md).
The [previous step](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) in the onboarding path is to reproduce BM25 baselines for the MS MARCO passage ranking task in Pyserini.
In general, don't try to rush through this guide by just blindly copying and pasting commands into a shell;
that's what I call [cargo culting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).
Instead, really try to understand what's going on.

**Learning outcomes** for this guide, building on previous steps in the onboarding path:

+ Understand how sparse and dense representations can be viewed as variations in a bi-encoder architecture.
+ Be able to identify correspondences between Lucene indexing and retrieval operations within the above conceptual framework.
+ Be able to extract the BM25 vector representation of a document from a Lucene index and compute its inner product with respect to a query.
+ Understand the difference between dense and sparse representations, and between supervised (learned) and unsupervised (heuristic) representations.

## Bi-Encoders

As a recap from [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md), this is the "core retrieval" problem that we're trying to solve:

> Given an information need expressed as a query _q_, the text retrieval task is to return a ranked list of _k_ texts {_d<sub>1</sub>_, _d<sub>2</sub>_ ... _d<sub>k</sub>_} from an arbitrarily large but finite collection
of texts _C_ = {_d<sub>i</sub>_} that maximizes a metric of interest, for example, nDCG, AP, etc.

How might we tackle the challenge?
One approach, known as a bi-encoder (or dual-encoder) architecture, is presented below:

<img src="images/architecture-biencoder.png" width="400" />

The approach is conceptually quite simple:
Let's say we have two "encoders":

+ The **document encoder** takes a document and generates a representation of the document.
+ The **query encoder** takes a query and generates a representation of the query.

In addition, we have a **comparison function** that takes two representations (one from a document, the other from a query) and produces an estimate of relevance, i.e., the degree to which the document is relevant to the query.
In other words, the comparison function produces a relevance score; alternatively, we call this a query-document score.

Let's assume that the encoders generate representations in the form of **vectors**, and that the score is computed in terms of the **inner product** (or **dot product**) between the document and query vectors.

Let's further assume that the encoders have been designed or built in such a way that the larger the score (i.e., inner product), the more relevant the document is to the query.
(Exactly how, we'll see later.)

Given this setup, how would we build a retrieval system?
Well, here's one obvious way:

**Step (1).** Let's take the document collection (or corpus), i.e., _C_ = {_d<sub>i</sub>_}, and encode each document.
So we have a bunch of vectors now, each corresponding to one document.

**Step (2).** When a query arrives, we need to encode it, i.e., generate its vector representation.

**Step (3).** In the final step, we need to find the _k_ document vectors that have the highest query-document scores in terms of the inner product of their vector representations.
We say _k_ because in nearly all settings, _k_ is specified externally, i.e., the user says, give me the top 10 hits.
Hence, top-_k_ retrieval.

Step (1) and step (2) are relatively straightforward given the document and query encoders.
Encoding the document collection is embarrassingly parallel and encoding the query happens at search time.

Step (3) has a very naive implementation: take the query vector, compute its score with the vector of the first document, compute its score with the vector of the second document, compute its score with the vector of the third document, etc.
Repeat until we iterate through all documents, keeping track of the top-_k_ scores along the way (e.g., in a heap).
In other words, compute all inner products in a brute-force manner.

Don't laugh, this isn't as ridiculous as it sounds!
(For later, this is in fact what's happening with a `FlatIP` index in Faiss.)
However, researchers have developed more efficient data structures and top-_k_ retrieval algorithms for vectors of different types.
As a preview: for sparse vectors, we use inverted indexes, and for dense vectors, we use HNSW.

## BM25 as a Bi-Encoder

Now, okay, what does that have to do with retrieval using BM25?

Well, BM25 is simply an "instantiation" of the above bi-encoder framework, where BM25 is the document encoder and the query encoder generates a so-called multi-hot vector, like this:

<img src="images/architecture-bm25.png" width="400" />

Wait, seriously?

Yup!
Let's consider `docid` 7187158, the answer to the query about Paula Deen's brother:

```
Paula Deen and her brother Earl W. Bubba Hiers are being sued by a former general manager at Uncle Bubba'sâ¦ Paula Deen and her brother Earl W. Bubba Hiers are being sued by a former general manager at Uncle Bubba'sâ
```

This is the BM25 vector representation for that document:

```json
{
    "be": 2.637899875640869,
    "brother": 4.09124231338501,
    "bubba": 7.102361679077148,
    "bubba's\u00e2": 11.091651916503906,
    "deen": 7.4197235107421875,
    "earl": 5.663764953613281,
    "former": 3.8262834548950195,
    "gener": 2.2932770252227783,
    "her": 2.7393782138824463,
    "hier": 8.24051284790039,
    "manag": 2.832794189453125,
    "paula": 6.438521862030029,
    "su": 5.404428005218506,
    "uncl": 5.362298488616943,
    "w": 3.9339818954467773
}
```

This requires a bit of explanation.
As previously mentioned, BM25 is a so-called "bag-of-words" model, which means that the representation of the document is a **sparse** vector, where each dimension corresponds to a term in the vocabulary space.
Usually, we say "terms" (or sometimes "tokens") instead of "words" because there's some amount of processing to tokenize the input document.
Typically, words are converted into lower case, "stopwords" are discarded, and some form of stemming is applied (e.g., to remove suffixes).

In a bag-of-words representation, the dimension of the sparse vector is the size of the vocabulary space, i.e., the number of unique terms in the entire collection (i.e., all documents).
It's called a "bag of words" because we're only keeping track of the individual terms in a document, neglecting other important aspects of "meaning" such as the order of the terms, linguistic relationships, etc.
Sometimes, these are called sparse _lexical_ vectors, to emphasize that their dimensions correspond to lexical items (i.e., terms in the vocabulary).

Since most of the entries in a sparse vector (representing a document) are zero, it can be conveniently represented in JSON, with the keys denoting the terms that have non-zero weights (or scores).
This is what we've done above.
The weights (or scores) of those terms are determined by the [BM25 scoring function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25), which is a function of various term statistics such as the term frequency (the number of times a term appears in a document), the term's document frequency (the number of documents in the collection that contains the term), the document length, etc.

However, the high-level idea is that "important" terms get high weights, and "unimportant" terms get low weights.
BM25 is just one (of many) scoring functions that attempt to capture this intuition.

Who came up with the BM25 scoring function?
Its origins date back to the 1970s, but you can find a good overview from 2009 [here](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf).

So, the indexing phase with Lucene, as in the [previous exercise](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) you've done, corresponds to the green box below:

<img src="images/architecture-bm25a.png" width="400" />

Conceptually, you've computed the BM25 document vector of every document in the collection and stored them in a data structure called an inverted index.
(Actually, in reality, the inverted index only stores component statistics that allow you to reconstruct the BM25 document vectors.)

With the `LuceneIndexReader` class in Pyserini, you can materialize (i.e., reconstruct) the BM25 document vector for a particular document:

```python
from pyserini.index.lucene import LuceneIndexReader
import json

index_reader = LuceneIndexReader('indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-passage')
tf = index_reader.get_document_vector('7187158')
bm25_weights = \
    {term: index_reader.compute_bm25_term_weight('7187158', term, analyzer=None) \
     for term in tf.keys()}

print(json.dumps(bm25_weights, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
```

The above snippet of code will generate exactly the same JSON above.

Once you've built an index, the retrieval stage corresponds to the purple box below:

<img src="images/architecture-bm25b.png" width="400" />

The below snippet of code generates the query representation:

```python
from pyserini.analysis import Analyzer, get_lucene_analyzer

analyzer = Analyzer(get_lucene_analyzer())
query_tokens = analyzer.analyze('what is paula deen\'s brother')
multihot_query_weights = {k: 1 for k in query_tokens}
```

The query tokens (`query_tokens`) are:

```
['what', 'paula', 'deen', 'brother']
```

The query representation is simply a sparse vector where all the query tokens get a score (weight) of one.
This is also known as a "multi-hot vector".
We represent the query vector as a Python dictionary in `multihot_query_weights`.

As described above, the top-_k_ retrieval problem is to find the _k_ documents from the collection that have the highest inner product (between a document vector and the query vector).
Without getting into details, the inverted index allows this top-_k_ to be computed efficiently.

Here, we can manually compute the inner product between the query vector and the document vector:

```python
import numpy as np

# Gather up the dimensions (i.e., the combined dictionary).
terms = set.union(set(bm25_weights.keys()), set(multihot_query_weights.keys()))

bm25_vec = np.array([ bm25_weights.get(t, 0) for t in terms ])
multihot_qvec = np.array([ multihot_query_weights.get(t, 0) for t in terms ])

np.dot(multihot_qvec, bm25_vec)
```

The dot product is `17.949487686157227`.

In the code snippet above, we're first creating numpy vectors for the document (`bm25_vec`) and the query (`multihot_qvec`).
The dimensions of the vectors are the (unique) union of the terms from the query and the document.
Then we use numpy's dot product method to compute the query-document score.

In the approach above, we perform the operations explicitly, but it's a bit roundabout.
Alternatively we can compute the dot product as follows:

```python
sum({term: bm25_weights[term] \
     for term in bm25_weights.keys() & \
     multihot_query_weights.keys()}.values())
```

Here, we are using a dictionary comprehension to generate a new dictionary that only contains the keys (terms) that appear in _both_ the query and the document.
Then we sum up the values (i.e., the term weights) to arrive at the query-document score.
This is exactly the inner product of the `multihot_qvec` and `bm25_vec` vectors since `multihot_qvec` is a vector of zeros and ones.
You should get exactly the same query-document score.

Let's try searching with the same query using Lucene:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher('indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-passage')
hits = searcher.search('what is paula deen\'s brother')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

You'll see that hit 1, `docid` 7187158, has a score of `17.94950`, which is the same as the score we computed by hand (modulo rounding).

Taking stock of where we're at:
This section explains how retrieval with BM25 (e.g., with Lucene), is an instantiation of the bi-encoder architecture.
Repeat the same exercise above for a few other queries (make them up) to convince yourself.

## Transformers in Bi-Encoders

Let's go back and look at the bi-encoder architecture again.

<img src="images/architecture-biencoder.png" width="400" />

With BM25, the document encoder generates sparse lexical (or bag-of-words) vectors.
We can imagine encoders generating other types of vector representations.

The two major axes of variations are:

+ The basis of the representation vectors (sparse vs. dense).
They could be sparse vectors (as in the case of BM25) or they could be dense vectors.
In the case of dense vectors, the dimensions of the vectors putatively capture some "latent semantic space".
Thus, we often contrast sparse lexical vector with dense semantic vectors.
+ Whether the representations are learned (supervised vs. unsupervised).
In the case of BM25, there is no "learning" (modulo minor parameter tuning): the BM25 scoring function specifies the weights that each term should receive.
BM25 was derived from a probabilistic model of retrieval and has evolved over many decades (see [here](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf)), but it is _not_ the product of a (supervised) machine-learning approach.
Alternatively, document and query representations can be _learned_ from large amounts of data.
So, we have a contrast between unsupervised (or heuristic) representations and supervised (or learned) representations.

Indeed, dense retrieval models usually refer to encoders that _learn_ to produce dense semantic representations using, you guessed it, transformer models!
Where do the training data come from?
Again, you got it: datasets such as MS MARCO.

So the picture for dense retrieval looks like this:

<img src="images/architecture-dense.png" width="400" />

When people say "vector search" or "semantic search" these days, they're referring to the picture above.
Often, the outputs of the encoders are called **embedding vectors**, or just **embeddings** for short.

Again, to summarize:
We often say that dense retrieval models generate learned dense representations.
In contrast, BM25 generates unsupervised (or heuristic) sparse representations.
To complete the possibilities, yes, there are learned sparse representations and unsupervised dense representations as well.

We'll save a more complete exploration of this design space for some other time, but they're sketched out in this article (on which this guide is based) if you want to learn more:

Okay, that's it for this lesson.
Next, you're going to play with [an actual dense retrieval model](experiments-nfcorpus.md).

# Pyserini: A Deeper Dive into Dense and Sparse Representations

In a [previous guide](conceptual-framework.md), we introduced a conceptual framework for a representational approach to information retrieval that integrates dense and sparse representations into the same underlying (bi-encoder) architecture.
This guide offers a deeper dive that connects the high-level concepts with the actual code implementation.

If you're a Waterloo student traversing the [onboarding path](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ura.md) (which [starts here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md)),
make sure you've first done the previous step, [reproducing a dense retrieval baseline for NFCorpus](experiments-nfcorpus.md).
In general, don't try to rush through this guide by just blindly copying and pasting commands into a shell;
that's what I call [cargo culting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).
Instead, really try to understand what's going on.

Following the onboarding path, this lesson does **not** introduce any new concepts.
Rather, the focus is to solidify previously introduced concepts and to connect the bi-encoder architecture to implementations in Pyserini.
Informally, we're "peeling back the covers".

**Learning outcomes** for this guide, building on previous steps in the onboarding path, are divided into three parts.
With respect to dense retrieval models:

1. Be able to materialize and inspect dense vectors stored in Faiss.
2. Be able to encode documents and queries with the BGE-base model and manipulate the resulting vector representations.
3. Be able to compute query-document scores (i.e., retrieval scores) "by hand" for dense retrieval, by directly manipulating the vectors.
4. Be able to perform retrieval "by hand" given a query, by directly manipulating the document vectors stored in the index.

With respect to sparse (i.e., bag-of-words) retrieval models:

1. Be able to materialize and inspect BM25 document vectors from a Lucene inverted index.
2. Be able to compute query-document scores (i.e., retrieval scores) "by hand" for bag-of-words retrieval, by directly manipulating the vectors.
3. Be able to perform retrieval "by hand" given a query, by directly manipulating the document vectors materialized from the inverted index.

And putting the two together:

+ Understand how dense retrieval and sparse (bag-of-words) retrieval are different realizations of the same bi-encoder architecture.
+ Be able to connect key concepts in the bi-encoder architecture to Pyserini implementations.
+ Be able to "trace" retrieval with dense and sparse representations through the encoding and top-_k_ retrieval phases.

## Recap

As a recap from [here](conceptual-framework.md), this is the "core retrieval" problem that we're trying to solve:

> Given an information need expressed as a query _q_, the text retrieval task is to return a ranked list of _k_ texts {_d<sub>1</sub>_, _d<sub>2</sub>_ ... _d<sub>k</sub>_} from an arbitrarily large but finite collection
of texts _C_ = {_d<sub>i</sub>_} that maximizes a metric of interest, for example, nDCG, AP, etc.

And this is the bi-encoder architecture for tackling the above challenge:

<img src="images/architecture-biencoder.png" width="400" />

It's all about representations!
BM25 generates bag-of-words sparse lexical vectors where the terms are assigned BM25 weights in an unsupervised manner.
Contriever and BGE-base, which are examples of dense retrieval models, use transformer-based encoders, trained on large amounts of supervised data, that generate _dense_ vectors.

## Dense Retrieval Models

Let's start by first peeking inside the Faiss index we built:

```python
import faiss

index = faiss.read_index('indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/index')
num_vectors = index.ntotal
```

<details>
<summary>Try it with Contriever:</summary>
<br/>

```python
import faiss

index_c = faiss.read_index('indexes/faiss.nfcorpus.contriever-msmacro/index')
num_vectors_c = index_c.ntotal
```

</details>
<br/>

We see, from `num_vectors`, that there are 3633 vectors in this index.
That's a vector (or alternatively, embedding) for each document.

We can print out first 10 vectors:

```python
for i in range(10):
    vector = index.reconstruct(i)
    print(f"Vector {i}: {vector}")
```

<details>
<summary>Contriever:</summary>
<br/>

```python
for i in range(10):
    vector_c = index_c.reconstruct(i)
    print(f"Vector {i}: {vector_c}")
```

</details>
<br/>

Pyserini stores the `docid` corresponding to each vector separately.
In the code snippet below, we load in the mapping data and then look up the vector corresponding to `MED-4555`.

```python
docids = []
with open('indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/docid', 'r') as fin:
    docids = [line.rstrip() for line in fin.readlines()]

v1 = index.reconstruct(docids.index('MED-4555'))
```

<details>
<summary>Contriever:</summary>
<br/>

```python
docids_c = []
with open('indexes/faiss.nfcorpus.contriever-msmacro/docid', 'r') as fin:
    docids_c = [line.rstrip() for line in fin.readlines()]

v1_c = index_c.reconstruct(docids_c.index('MED-4555'))
```

</details>
<br/>

So, `v1` now holds the dense vector representation (i.e., embedding) of document `MED-4555`.

Now, where did this vector come from?
Well, it's the output of the encoder.
Let's verify this by first encoding the contents of the document, which is in `doc_text`:

```python
# This is the string contents of doc MED-4555
doc_text = 'Analysis of risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm in a cohort of more than 3 million individuals. BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk. METHODS: We used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We observed a positive association with increasing years of smoking and cigarettes smoked and a negative association with smoking cessation. Excess weight was associated with increased risk, whereas exercise and consumption of nuts, vegetables, and fruits were associated with reduced risk. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had lower risk of AAA than whites and Native Americans. Well-known risk factors were reaffirmed, including male gender, age, family history, and cardiovascular disease. A predictive scoring system was created that identifies aneurysms more efficiently than current criteria and includes women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged <65 years. Using this model on national statistics of risk factors prevalence, we estimated 1.1 million AAAs in the United States, of which 569,000 are among women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged <65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation and a healthy lifestyle are associated with lower risk of AAA. We estimated that about half of the patients with AAA disease are not eligible for screening under current guidelines. We have created a high-yield screening algorithm that expands the target population for screening by including at-risk individuals not identified with existing screening criteria.'

from pyserini.encode import AutoDocumentEncoder
encoder = AutoDocumentEncoder('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5', device='cpu', pooling='mean', l2_norm=True)

v2 = encoder.encode(doc_text)
```

<details>
<summary>Contriever:</summary>
<br/>

```python
from pyserini.encode import AutoDocumentEncoder
encoder_c = AutoDocumentEncoder('facebook/contriever-msmarco', device='cpu', pooling='mean')

v2_c = encoder_c.encode(doc_text)
```

</details>
<br/>

Minor detail here: the encoder is designed to work on batches of input, so the actual vector representation is `v2[0]`.

We can verify that the vector we generated using the encoder is identical to the vector that is stored in the index by computing the L2 norm (which should be almost zero):

```python
import numpy as np
np.linalg.norm(v2[0] - v1)
```

<details>
<summary>Contriever:</summary>
<br/>

```python
import numpy as np
np.linalg.norm(v2_c[0] - v1_c)
```

</details>
<br/>

Let's push this further and work through a query.
Consider the query "How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms", which is `PLAIN-3074`.
We can perform interactive retrieval as follows:

Let's go ahead and encode the query, producing the query vector `q_vec`:

```python
from pyserini.encode import AutoQueryEncoder

q_encoder = AutoQueryEncoder('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5', device='cpu', pooling='mean', l2_norm=True)
q_vec = q_encoder.encode('How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms')
```

Then, we compute the dot product between the query vector `q_vec` and the document vector `v1` (which is the representation of document `MED-4555` generated by the document encoder):

```python
np.dot(q_vec, v1)
```

We should arrive at the same score as above (`0.7913785`).
In other words, the query-document score (i.e., the relevance score of the document with respect to the query) is exactly the dot product of the two vector representations.
This is as expected!

<br/>

```python
from pyserini.encode import AutoQueryEncoder

q_encoder_c = AutoQueryEncoder('facebook/contriever-msmarco', device='cpu', pooling='mean')
q_vec_c = q_encoder_c.encode('How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms')
```

Then, we compute the dot product between the query vector `q_vec_c` and the document vector `v1_c` (which is the representation of document `MED-4555` generated by the document encoder):

```python
np.dot(q_vec_c, v1_c)
```

We should arrive at the same score as above (`1.472201`).

</details>
<br/>

We can take this a step further and manually perform retrieval by computing the dot product between the query vector and _all_ document vectors.
The corpus is small enough that this is practical:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

scores = []
# Iterate through all document vectors and compute dot product.
for i in tqdm(range(num_vectors)):
    vector = index.reconstruct(i)
    score = np.dot(q_vec, vector)
    scores.append([docids[i], score])

# Sort by score descending.
scores.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])

for s in scores[:10]:
    print(f'{s[0]} {s[1]:.6f}')
```

In a bit more detail, we iterate through all document vectors in the index, compute its dot product with the query vector, and append the results in `scores`.
After going through the entire corpus in this manner, we sort the results and print out the top-10.
This sorting operation corresponds to top-_k_ retrieval.

We can see that the output is the same as search with `FaissSearcher` above.
This is exactly as expected.

    score_c = np.dot(q_vec_c, vector_c)
    scores_c.append([docids_c[i], score_c])

# Sort by score descending.
scores_c.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])

for s in scores_c[:10]:
    print(f'{s[0]} {s[1]:.6f}')
```

Again, the output is the same as search with `FaissSearcher` above.

## Sparse Retrieval Models

Now, we're going to basically do the same thing, but with BM25.
The point here is to illustrate how dense and sparse retrieval are conceptually identical &mdash; they're both instantiations of the bi-encoder architecture.
The primary difference is the encoder representation, i.e., the vectors that the encoders generate.

We have to start with a bit of data munging, since the Lucene indexer expects the documents in a slightly different format.
Start by creating a new sub-directory:

```bash
mkdir collections/nfcorpus/pyserini-corpus
```

Now run the following Python script to munge the data into the right format:

```python
import json

with open('collections/nfcorpus/pyserini-corpus/corpus.jsonl', 'w') as out:
    with open('collections/nfcorpus/corpus.jsonl', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            l = json.loads(line)
            s = json.dumps({'id': l['_id'], 'contents': l['title'] + ' ' + l['text']})
            out.write(s + '\n')
```

We can now index these documents as a `JsonCollection` using Pyserini:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --input collections/nfcorpus/pyserini-corpus/ \
  --index indexes/lucene.nfcorpus \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw
```

Perform retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene.nfcorpus \
  --topics collections/nfcorpus/queries.tsv \
  --output runs/run.beir-bm25.nfcorpus.txt \
  --hits 1000 --bm25 \
  --threads 4 --batch-size 16
```

And evaluate the retrieval run:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval \
  -c -m ndcg_cut.10 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels \
  runs/run.beir-bm25.nfcorpus.txt
```

The expected results are:

```
Results:
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.3218
```

We can also perform retrieval interactively:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher('indexes/lucene.nfcorpus')
hits = searcher.search('How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.4f}')
```

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 MED-4555 11.9305
 2 MED-4423 8.4771
 3 MED-3180 7.1896
 4 MED-2718 6.0102
 5 MED-1309 5.8181
 6 MED-4424 5.7448
 7 MED-1705 5.6101
 8 MED-4902 5.3639
 9 MED-1009 5.2533
10 MED-1512 5.2068
```

So far, none of this is new:
We did exactly the same thing for [the MS MARCO passage ranking test collection](experiments-msmarco-passage.md), but now we're doing it for NFCorpus.

Next, let's generate the BM25 document vector for doc `MED-4555`, the same document we examined above.

```python
from pyserini.index.lucene import LuceneIndexReader
import json

index_reader = LuceneIndexReader('indexes/lucene.nfcorpus')
tf = index_reader.get_document_vector('MED-4555')
bm25_weights = \
    {term: index_reader.compute_bm25_term_weight('MED-4555', term, analyzer=None) \
     for term in tf.keys()}

print(json.dumps(bm25_weights, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
```

The variable `bm25_weights` is a Python dictionary holding the BM25 weights for the document.

We're going to now perform retrieval "by hand" with BM25, similar to what we did above with the dense retrieval model.
Let's start by encoding the query, which is a multi-hot vector where the non-zero items correspond to the query terms:

```python
from pyserini.analysis import Analyzer, get_lucene_analyzer

analyzer = Analyzer(get_lucene_analyzer())
query_tokens = analyzer.analyze('How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms')
multihot_query_weights = {k: 1 for k in query_tokens}
```

The variable `multihot_query_weights` is a Python dictionary where the keys correspond to the query tokens, each with a value of one.

Now let's compute the dot product of the two vectors.

```python
sum({term: bm25_weights[term] \
     for term in bm25_weights.keys() & \
     multihot_query_weights.keys()}.values())
```

The dot product is `11.9305`.

Again, this isn't anything new.
We did all of this in the [conceptual framework guide](conceptual-framework.md) with MS MARCO passage; we're just now doing it on NFCorpus.

The above expression for computing a dot product &mdash; let's wrap in a Python function, and then verify it gives the same output:

```python
def dot(q_weights, d_weights):
    return sum({term: d_weights[term] \
                for term in d_weights.keys() & \
                q_weights.keys()}.values())

dot(multihot_query_weights, bm25_weights)
```

With this setup, we can now perform end-to-end retrieval for a query "by hand", by directly manipulating the index structures:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher
from pyserini.index.lucene import LuceneIndexReader
from tqdm import tqdm

searcher = LuceneSearcher('indexes/lucene.nfcorpus')
index_reader = LuceneIndexReader('indexes/lucene.nfcorpus')

scores = []
# Iterate through all docids in the index.
for i in tqdm(range(0, searcher.num_docs)):
    docid = searcher.doc(i).get('id')
    # Reconstruct the BM25 document vector.
    tf = index_reader.get_document_vector(docid)
    bm25_weights = \
        {term: index_reader.compute_bm25_term_weight(docid, term, analyzer=None) \
         for term in tf.keys()}
    # Compute and retain the query-document score.
    score = dot(multihot_query_weights, bm25_weights)
    scores.append([docid, score])

# Sort by score descending.
scores.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])

for s in scores[:10]:
    print(f'{s[0]} {s[1]:.4f}')
```

The code snippet above should be self-explanatory.
We iterate through all documents, reconstruct the BM25 document vectors (as weights in a Python dictionary), compute the dot product with the query vector, and retain the scores.
Once we've gone through all documents in the corpus in this manner, we sort the scores and print out the top-_k_.

The output should match the results from `LuceneSearcher` above.

To recap, what's the point for this exercise?

+ We see that dense retrieval and sparse retrieval are both instantiations of a bi-encoder architecture. The only difference is the output of the encoder representations.
+ For both a dense index (Faiss) and a sparse index (Lucene), you now know how to reconstruct the document vector representations.
+ For both a dense retrieval model and a sparse retrieval model, you now know how to encode a query into a query vector.
+ For both a dense retrieval model and a sparse retrieval model, you know how to compute query-document scores: they're just dot products.
+ Finally, for both a dense retrieval model and a sparse retrieval model, you can perform retrieval "by hand". This can be accomplished by iterating through all document vectors in the index and computing its dot product with the query vector in a brute force manner. By sorting the scores, you're performing top-_k_ retrieval, which gives exactly the same output as `FaissSearcher` and `LuceneSearcher` (although not as efficient).

Okay, that's it for this lesson.

The next lesson will provide [a deeper dive into learned sparse representations](conceptual-framework3.md).

# Pyserini: A Deeper Dive into Learned Sparse Representations

In a [previous guide](conceptual-framework2.md), we introduced a conceptual framework for a representational approach to information retrieval that integrates dense and sparse representations into the same underlying (bi-encoder) architecture.
This guide offers a deeper dive with learned sparse retrieval, where we use SPLADE-v3, a learned sparse model to encode the corpus into sparse vectors, index them into retrieval system with inverted index, and finally perform retrieval and evaluation.

If you're a Waterloo student traversing the [onboarding path](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ura.md) (which [starts here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md)),
make sure you've first done the previous step, [reproducing a dense retrieval baseline for NFCorpus](experiments-nfcorpus.md).
In general, don't try to rush through this guide by just blindly copying and pasting commands into a shell;
that's what I call [cargo culting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).
Instead, really try to understand what's going on.

Following the onboarding path, this lesson does **not** introduce any new concepts.
Rather, the focus is to solidify previously introduced concepts and to connect the bi-encoder architecture to implementations in Pyserini.
Informally, we're "peeling back the covers".

**Learning outcomes** for this guide, building on previous steps in the onboarding path, are divided into three parts.
1. Be able to encode a corpus into its sparse vector representations with SPLADE-v3.
2. Be able to index them into a retrieval system using Lucene inverted index.
3. Be able to compute query-document scores (i.e., retrieval scores) with pyserini for SPLADE retrieval.
4. Be able to perform retrieval with pyserini given a query.

## Recap

As a recap from [here](conceptual-framework.md), this is the "core retrieval" problem that we're trying to solve:

> Given an information need expressed as a query _q_, the text retrieval task is to return a ranked list of _k_ texts {_d<sub>1</sub>_, _d<sub>2</sub>_ ... _d<sub>k</sub>_} from an arbitrarily large but finite collection
of texts _C_ = {_d<sub>i</sub>_} that maximizes a metric of interest, for example, nDCG, AP, etc.

And this is the bi-encoder architecture for tackling the above challenge:

<img src="images/architecture-biencoder.png" width="400" />

It's all about representations!
BM25 generates bag-of-words sparse lexical vectors where the terms are assigned BM25 weights in an unsupervised manner.
Contriever and BGE-base, which are examples of dense retrieval models, use transformer-based encoders, trained on large amounts of supervised data, that generate _dense_ vectors.

## Learned Sparse Retrieval Models

Now, we're going to basically do the same thing, but with SPLADE-v3 instead of BM25.
A learned sparse model, such as **SPLADE-v3**, extends traditional bag-of-words models like BM25 by incorporating machine learning to optimize term weights and representations. While BM25 relies on fixed, rule-based scoring (e.g., term frequency and inverse document frequency), learned sparse models use neural networks to predict the importance of terms in a query or document, often producing sparse vectors where only the most relevant terms have non-zero weights. This allows learned sparse models to capture semantic relationships and context better than BoW models, which treat terms independently. However, both approaches result in sparse representations, making them efficient for retrieval tasks.

Start by creating the directories where we will store the encoded documents:

```bash
mkdir encode
cd encode
mkdir nfcorpus.splade-v3
```

We can then setup to use SPLADE-v3:
First, we need to request access to SPLADE-v3 model on Hugging Face since it is gated:
1. Create an account for Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/join
2. Go to the model page on Hugging Face: [Splade-v3](https://huggingface.co/naver/splade-v3)
3. Click the "Log In" button.

Next, we need to authenticate with Hugging Face:
If you don’t already have the Hugging Face CLI installed, install it using:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

Run the following command to log in to your Hugging Face account:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

You’ll be prompted to enter your Hugging Face API token. You can generate a token from your Hugging Face account settings:
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens.
2. Click **"New token"** to generate a token.
3. For your token's permissions, give “Read access to contents of all public gated repos you can access”.
4. Copy the token and paste it into the terminal when prompted.

We are now all set to use SPLADE-v3 model!

Start by running the following command to encode the corpus into sparse vector representations.

```bash
python -m pyserini.encode \
  input --corpus collections/nfcorpus/corpus.jsonl \
        --fields title text \
  output --embeddings encode/nfcorpus.splade-v3 \
  encoder --encoder naver/splade-v3 \
          --encoder-class splade \
          --fields title text \
          --max-length 512
```

Next, we will index the encoded corpus using inverted index into a retrieval system.

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input encode/nfcorpus.splade-v3 \
  --index index/nfcorpus.splade-v3 \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 4 \
  --impact \
  --pretokenized
```
Here, we used pretokenized flag as splade already split the text into tokens (words and subwords) in the sparse vector.

Perform retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index index/nfcorpus.splade-v3 \
  --topics collections/nfcorpus/queries.tsv \
  --output runs/run.splade.txt \
  --hits 1000 \
  --encoder naver/splade-v3 \
  --remove-query \
  --output-format trec \
  --impact \
  --threads 4
```
The runs will be stored in runs/run.splade.txt.

And evaluate the retrieval run:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval \
  -c -m ndcg_cut.10 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels \
  runs/run.splade.txt
```

The expected results are:

```
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.3624
```

We can also perform retrieval interactively:

```python
import torch
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneImpactSearcher
from pyserini.encode import SpladeQueryEncoder

encoder = SpladeQueryEncoder(model_name_or_path="naver/splade-v3", device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
searcher = LuceneImpactSearcher('index/nfcorpus.splade-v3', query_encoder=encoder)
hits = searcher.search('How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.6f}')
```

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 MED-4555 51131.000000
 2 MED-4423 36854.000000
 3 MED-3180 30411.000000
 4 MED-1679 30396.000000
 5 MED-3253 29326.000000
 6 MED-2007 28814.000000
 7 MED-1395 28016.000000
 8 MED-5300 27989.000000
 9 MED-4030 27699.000000
10 MED-1194 27588.000000
```
     
To recap, what's the point for this exercise?

# Pyserini: Reproducing 20Newsgroups Results

We're going to perform text classification using scikit on 20Newsgroups dataset.

## Data Prep

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
There are many versions of the 20 Newsgroups dataset available on the web, we're specifically going to use [this one](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) (the "bydate" version).

Please refer to instructions for [working the dataset in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-20newsgroups.md#data-prep) and copy index files under `pyserini/indexes/20newsgroups`, or use our prebuilt index using following commands:
 
```bash
mkdir indexes/20newsgroups
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/qo2wt6fzu01yt4c/lucene-index.20newsgroups.all.tar.gz -P indexes/20newsgroups
tar xvfz indexes/20newsgroups/lucene-index.20newsgroups.all.tar.gz -C indexes/20newsgroups
```
To confirm, `lucene-index.20newsgroups.all.tar.gz` should have MD5 checksum of `89ed27a08e3e77c51a9f1c28f0705da0`.

Here's the script that have everything put together

```bash
sh bin/get-20newsgroups-data.sh
```

Then we are going to use helper function to extract docid and labels in dataset.

```python
def get_info(path):
    docs = []
    targets = []
    for root, _, files in os.walk(path, topdown=False):
        for doc_id in files:
            docs.append(doc_id)
            category = root.split('/')[-1]
            targets.append(target_to_index[category])

    return docs, targets
```

Extract docids and labels in dataset

```python
import os

target_names = ['alt.atheism', 'comp.graphics', 'comp.os.ms-windows.misc', 'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware', 'comp.sys.mac.hardware',
                'comp.windows.x', 'misc.forsale', 'rec.autos', 'rec.motorcycles', 'rec.sport.baseball', 'rec.sport.hockey',
                'sci.crypt', 'sci.electronics', 'sci.med', 'sci.space', 'soc.religion.christian', 'talk.politics.guns',
                'talk.politics.mideast', 'talk.politics.misc', 'talk.religion.misc', ]

target_to_index = {t: i for i, t in enumerate(target_names)}

train_docs, train_labels = get_info('./collections/20newsgroups/20news-bydate-train/')
test_docs, test_labels = get_info('./collections/20newsgroups/20news-bydate-test/')
```

## Train and Test Classifier

Now pyserini support two vectorizers: BM25Vectorizer, TfidfVectorizer. We take TfifVectorizer as an example here.

```python
from pyserini.vectorizer import BM25Vectorizer, TfidfVectorizer

train_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer('indexes/20newsgroups/lucene-index.20newsgroups.all', min_df=5, verbose=True).get_vectors(train_docs)
test_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer('indexes/20newsgroups/lucene-index.20newsgroups.all', min_df=5, verbose=True).get_vectors(test_docs)
```

Now we use scikit learn to perform text classification.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# classifier
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(train_vectorizer, train_labels)
pred = clf.predict(test_vectorizer)
score = metrics.f1_score(test_labels, pred, average='macro')
print(f'f1 score: {score}')
```

You should get a score of `0.8359057600242041` for TfidfVectorizer and `0.8421606204336133` for BM25Vectorizer.

For the complete end-to-end experiments, run the following script:

```bash
python scripts/20newsgroups-replication.py --vectorizer BM25Vectorizer
```

# Pyserini: Reproducing ADORE Results

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the following dense retrieval work:

> Jingtao Zhan, Jiaxin Mao, Yiqun Liu, Jiafeng Guo, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma. [Optimizing Dense Retrieval Model Training with Hard Negatives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08051.pdf)

Starting with v0.12.0, you can reproduce these results directly from the [Pyserini PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/pyserini/).
Since dense retrieval depends on neural networks, Pyserini requires a more complex set of dependencies to use this feature.
See [package installation notes](../README.md#package-installation) for more details.

Note that we have observed minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

## MS MARCO Passage

**ADORE retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
                             --index msmarco-passage-adore-bf \
                             --encoded-queries adore-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
                             --batch-size 36 \
                             --threads 12 \
                             --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.adore.bf.tsv \
                             --output-format msmarco
```

The option `--encoded-queries` specifies the use of encoded queries (i.e., queries that have already been converted into dense vectors and cached).

Unfortunately, the "on-the-fly" query encoding, ie, convert text queries into dense vectors as part of the dense retrieval process is not available for this model. This is because the original ADORE implementation is based on an old version of transformers (`transformers=2.8.0`). Pyserini uses a higher version so that the base model (`roberta-base`) performs differently.

To evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.adore.bf.tsv 
#####################
MRR @10: 0.34661947969254514
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.adore.bf.tsv --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.adore.bf.trec
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.ance.bf.trec
map                   	all	0.3523
recall_1000           	all	0.9688
```

## TREC DL2019 Passage

**ANCE retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics dl19-passage  \
                             --index msmarco-passage-adore-bf \
                             --encoded-queries adore-dl19-passage \ 
                             --batch-size 36 \
                             --threads 12 \
                             --output runs/run.dl19-passage.adore.bf.trec
```

Same as above, you cannot use the "on-the-fly" query encoding feature.

To evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m map -m ndcg_cut.10 -m recall.1000 -l 2 dl19-passage runs/run.dl19-passage.adore.bf.trec
map                     all     0.4188
recall_1000             all     0.7759
ndcg_cut_10             all     0.6832
```

## TREC DL2020 Passage

**ANCE retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics dl20  \
                             --index msmarco-passage-adore-bf \
                             --encoded-queries adore-dl20-passage \ 
                             --batch-size 36 \
                             --threads 12 \
                             --output runs/run.dl20-passage.adore.bf.trec
```

Same as above, you cannot use the "on-the-fly" query encoding feature.

To evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m map -m ndcg_cut.10 -m recall.1000 -l 2 dl20-passage runs/run.dl20-passage.adore.bf.trec
map                     all     0.4418
recall_1000             all     0.8151
ndcg_cut_10             all     0.6655
```

# Pyserini: Aggretriever for MS MARCO (V1) Collections

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the Aggretriever dense retrieval model described in the following paper:

> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Minghan Li, and Jimmy Lin. [Aggretriever: A Simple Approach to Aggregate Textual Representation for Robust Dense Passage Retrieval.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00511) arXiv:2208.00511, July 2022. 

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.
The models, indexes and encoded queries are now on orca so we use the local path temporarily.

## MS MARCO Passage Ranking

Summary of results:

| Condition                                              | MRR@10 |    MAP | Recall@1000 |

### Aggretriever-DistilBERT Dense Retrieval

Dense retrieval with Aggretriever-DistilBERT, brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.aggretriever-distilbert \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \

  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-agg.bf.tsv \
  --output-format trec \
  --batch-size 36 --threads 12
```

Note that to ensure maximum reproducibility, by default Pyserini uses pre-computed query representations that are automatically downloaded. As an alternative, replace `--encoded-queries aggretriever-distilbert-msmarco-passage-dev-subset` with `--encoder castorini/aggretriever-distilbert` to perform "on-the-fly" query encoding, i.e., convert text queries into dense vectors as part of the dense retrieval process.

To evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 10 -m recip_rank msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
    runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-agg.bf.tsv

## Summary
Here's how our results stack up:

### Passage Ranking Datasets

#### TREC DL 2019 Passage

## Reproducing ANCE-PRF Results

To reproduce the ANCE-PRF results, it has certain limitations. 

First of all, different PRF depths need to use different `--ance-prf-encoder`, the one we provided is only for `k=3`, which means it can only do `--prf-depth 3`.

Second, it takes two more parameters, one `--ance-prf-encoder` which points to the checkpoint directory, and `--sparse-index` that points to a lucene index.

For the lucene index, it needs to have `--storeRaw` enabled when building the index.

To reproduce `TREC DL 2019 Passage`, use the command below, change `--ance-prf-encoder` to the path that stores the checkpoint (Remember to check if `merges.txt` exists in your checkpoint directory, if it doesn't, you can download this file from [roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base/tree/main) and add it to the checkpoint directory)
```
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics dl19-passage \                                               
    --index msmarco-passage-ance-bf \
    --encoder castorini/ance-msmarco-passage \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --output runs/run.dl19-passage.ance-prf3.trec \
    --prf-depth 3 \
    --prf-method ance-prf \
    --threads 12 \
    --sparse-index msmarco-passage \
    --ance-prf-encoder ckpt/ance_prf_k3_checkpoint
```

To evaluate:
```
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m ndcg_cut.10 -m recall.1000 -l 2 dl19-passage runs/run.dl19-passage.ance-prf3.trec
ndcg_cut_10         all     0.6807
recall_1000         all     0.7912
```

For `TREC DL 2020 Passage`:
```
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics dl20 \                                               
    --index msmarco-passage-ance-bf \

# Pyserini: Reproducing ANCE Results

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the following dense retrieval work:

> Lee Xiong, Chenyan Xiong, Ye Li, Kwok-Fung Tang, Jialin Liu, Paul Bennett, Junaid Ahmed, Arnold Overwijk. [Approximate Nearest Neighbor Negative Contrastive Learning for Dense Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00808.pdf)

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

## MS MARCO Passage

**ANCE retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.ance \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries ance-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.ance.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

The option `--encoded-queries` specifies the use of encoded queries (i.e., queries that have already been converted into dense vectors and cached).
As an alternative, replace with `--encoder castorini/ance-msmarco-passage` to perform "on-the-fly" query encoding, i.e., convert text queries into dense vectors as part of the dense retrieval process.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.ance.tsv
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3302
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.ance.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.ance.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
    runs/run.msmarco-passage.ance.trec
```

Results:

```
map                   	all	0.3363
recall_1000           	all	0.9584
```

## MS MARCO Document

**ANCE retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-doc.ance-maxp \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --encoded-queries ance_maxp-msmarco-doc-dev \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.ance-maxp.txt \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16 \
  --hits 1000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 100
```

Same as above, replace `--encoded-queries` with `--encoder castorini/ance-msmarco-doc-maxp` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_doc_eval \
  --judgments msmarco-doc-dev \
  --run runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.ance-maxp.txt
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @100: 0.3794
QueriesRanked: 5193
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@100. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.ance-maxp.txt \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.ance-maxp.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.100 -mmap msmarco-doc-dev \
  runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.ance-maxp.trec
```

Results:

```
map                   	all	0.3794
recall_100            	all	0.9033
```

## Natural Questions (NQ)

**ANCE retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.ance-multi \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --encoded-queries ance_multi-nq-test \
  --output runs/run.ance.nq-test.multi.trec \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Same as above, replace `--encoded-queries` with `--encoder castorini/ance-dpr-question-multi` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate, first convert the TREC output format to DPR's `json` format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/run.ance.nq-test.multi.trec \
  --output runs/run.ance.nq-test.multi.json

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.ance.nq-test.multi.json \
  --topk 20 100
```

Results:

```
Top20	accuracy: 0.8224
Top100	accuracy: 0.8787
```

## Trivia QA

**ANCE retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.ance-multi \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --encoded-queries ance_multi-trivia-test \
  --output runs/run.ance.trivia-test.multi.trec \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Same as above, replace `--encoded-queries` with `--encoder castorini/ance-dpr-question-multi` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate, first convert the TREC output format to DPR's `json` format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/run.ance.trivia-test.multi.trec \
  --output runs/run.ance.trivia-test.multi.json

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.ance.trivia-test.multi.json \
  --topk 20 100
```

Results:

```
Top20	accuracy: 0.8010
Top100	accuracy: 0.8522
```

# Pyserini: Reproducing AToMiC ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K Baselines

Pyserini provides the following pre-built indexes for the AToMiC dataset, encoded with [`laion/CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K`](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K):
- `atomic-v0.2.1.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.base`
- `atomic-v0.2.1.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.large`
- `atomic-v0.2.1.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation`
- `atomic-v0.2.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.base`
- `atomic-v0.2.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.large`
- `atomic-v0.2.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation`

## Data Prep
We need the topic directories (`ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation` and `ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation`) and the qrels files (`qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec` and `qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec`) to reproduce the baselines. This can be done by running the following script:

```bash
cd scripts/atomic
mkdir topics
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/TREC-AToMiC/AToMiC-Baselines/resolve/main/topics/ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation.tar.gz -P topics
tar -xzvf topics/ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation.tar.gz -C topics
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/TREC-AToMiC/AToMiC-Baselines/resolve/main/topics/ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation.tar.gz -P topics
tar -xzvf topics/ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation.tar.gz -C topics

mkdir qrels
wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/dlrudwo1269/AToMiC_bm25_files/resolve/main/qrels/qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec -P qrels
wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/dlrudwo1269/AToMiC_bm25_files/resolve/main/qrels/qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec -P qrels
```

## Convert Topics
We can convert the numpy topics to pyserini format as follows:
```bash
mkdir converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation && mkdir converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation
# Text
python convert_embeddings.py --encode-type text --inputs topics/ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation --topics-output converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation --embeddings-output converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation
# Image
python convert_embeddings.py --encode-type image --inputs topics/ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation --topics-output converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation --embeddings-output converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation
```

## Batch Retrieval Run
We can perform a batch retrieval run as follows, replacing `{setting}` with the desired setting (`base`, `large`, `validation`):
```bash
# Text to Image
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
    --topics converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation/topics.json \
    --index atomic-v0.2.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.{setting} \
    --hits 1000 \
    --encoded-queries converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.validation \
    --batch-size 256 \
    --threads 32 \
    --output run.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.t2i.{setting}.trec
  
# Image to Text
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
    --topics converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation/topics.json \
    --index atomic-v0.2.1.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.text.{setting} \
    --hits 1000 \
    --encoded-queries converted.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.image.validation \
    --batch-size 256 \
    --threads 32 \
    --output run.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.i2t.{setting}.trec
```

We can evaluate using `trec_eval`:
```bash
# Text to Image
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recip_rank -M 10 qrels/qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec run.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.t2i.{setting}.trec
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.10,1000 qrels/qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec run.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.t2i.{setting}.trec

# Image to Text
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recip_rank -M 10 qrels/qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec run.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.i2t.{setting}.trec
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.10,1000 qrels/qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec run.ViT-L-14.laion2b_s32b_b82k.i2t.{setting}.trec

# Pyserini: Reproducing AToMiC BM 25 Baselines

Pyserini provides the following pre-built indexes for the AToMiC dataset to reproduce the baselines in the [AToMiC paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01961.pdf):
- `atomic_text_v0.2.1_small_validation`
- `atomic_text_v0.2.1_base`
- `atomic_text_v0.2.1_large`
- `atomic_image_v0.2_small_validation`
- `atomic_image_v0.2_base`
- `atomic_image_v0.2_large`

## Data Prep
We need the topic files (`topics.atomic.validation.text.jsonl` and `topics.atomic.validation.image-caption.jsonl`) and the qrels files (`qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec` and `qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec`) to reproduce the baselines given in the paper.

The required files are located under [`pyserini/tools/topics-and-qrels/`](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-tools/tree/7b84f773225b5973b4533dfa0aa18653409a6146/topics-and-qrels). If you have a dev installation of pyserini, you can simply access the files there.
Otherwise,
```bash
export DATA_DIR="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castorini/anserini-tools/master/topics-and-qrels"

mkdir topics
wget ${DATA_DIR}/topics.atomic.validation.text.jsonl -P topics
wget ${DATA_DIR}/topics.atomic.validation.image-caption.jsonl -P topics

mkdir qrels
wget ${DATA_DIR}/qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec -P qrels
wget ${DATA_DIR}/qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec -P qrels
```

## Batch Retrieval Run
We can perform a batch retrieval run as follows, replacing `{setting}` with the desired setting (`small.validation`, `base`, `large`):
```bash
# Text to Image
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index atomic_text_v0.2.1_{setting} \
  --topics topics.atomic.validation.text.jsonl \
  --output runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.t2i.{setting}.trec \
  --bm25 --hits 1000 --threads 16 --batch-size 64
  
# Image to Text
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index atomic_image_v0.2_{setting} \
  --topics topics.atomic.validation.image-caption.jsonl\
  --output runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.i2t.{setting}.trec \
  --bm25 --hits 1000 --threads 16 --batch-size 64
```

We can evaluate using `trec_eval`:
```bash
# Text to Image
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recip_rank -M 10 qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.t2i.{setting}.trec
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.10,1000 qrels.atomic.validation.t2i.trec runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.t2i.{setting}.trec

# Image to Text
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recip_rank -M 10 qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.i2t.{setting}.trec
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.10,1000 qrels.atomic.validation.i2t.trec runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.i2t.{setting}.trec
```

## Known Issues
We have noticed that using `python -m pyserini.search.lucene` can be slow for certain queries (especially when searching using the `large` indexes). Using Anserini's `SearchCollection` can significantly speed up the search time. This can be done in a Python shell as follows:
```python
from pyserini.pyclass import autoclass
SearchCollection = autoclass("io.anserini.search.SearchCollection")
# Text to Image
t2i_search_args = [
    "-index", "lucene-index.atomic.image.{setting}",
    "-topics", "validation.text.search.jsonl",
    "-topicreader", "JsonString",
    "-topicfield", "title",
    "-output", "runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.t2i.{setting}.trec",
    "-bm25", "-hits", "1000", "-parallelism", "64", "-threads", "64"

]
# Image to Text
i2t_search_args = [
    "-index", "lucene-index.atomic.text.{setting}",
    "-topics", "validation.image-caption.search.jsonl",
    "-topicreader", "JsonString",
    "-topicfield", "title",
    "-output", "runs/run.validation.bm25-anserini-default.i2t.{setting}.trec",
    "-bm25", "-hits", "1000", "-parallelism", "64", "-threads", "64"
]
SearchCollection.main(search_args)
```

# Pyserini: Fusion on the BEIR Datasets

This page documents the results of running fusion retrieval on the BEIR datasets using Pyserini with BM25 and BGE indexes.

Currently, Pyserini provides support for the following fusion methods:

### **RRF** = Reciprocal Rank Fusion
Rank-based fusion using reciprocal ranks: `RRF_score(d) = Σ(1 / (k + rank_i(d)))` where `k=60`.  
### **Average** = Averaging scores on a list of runs
Simple arithmetic mean: `Average_score(d) = (1/n) × Σ(score_i(d))`
### **Interpolation** = Weighted sum of two runs
Weighted combination: `Interpolation_score(d) = α × score_1(d) + (1-α) × score_2(d)` where `α=0.5`

### **Normalize** = Average of scores normalized between [0, 1] (optimized implementation)
Min-max normalization then averaging: `Normalized_score_i(d) = (score_i(d) - min_i) / (max_i - min_i)`

## Results

For all experiments recorded here, the values k = 1000, depth = 1000, rrf_k = 60, and alpha = 0.5 were used.

The runs of two models were fused:
+ **BM25**: Sparse retrieval using flat BM25 index
+ **BGE**: Dense retrieval using bge-base-en-v1.5 with dense flat index

Since there were only two runs fused, the average and interpolation methods produced the same results.

Three metrics were used for evaluation: nDCG@10, R@100, and R@1000.

The table below reports the effectiveness of the methods with the nDCG@10 metric and the base runs fused for reference:

# Pyserini: Reproducing BPR Results

Binary passage retriever (BPR) is a two-stage ranking approach that represents the passages in both binary codes and dense vectors for memory efficiency and effectiveness.

> Ikuya Yamada, Akari Asai, Hannaneh Hajishirzi. [Efficient Passage Retrieval with Hashing for Open-domain Question Answering.](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.123/) _Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 2: Short Papers)_, pages 979-986, 2021.

We have replicated BPR's results and incorporated the model into Pyserini.
To be clear, we started with model checkpoint and index releases in the official [BPR repo](https://github.com/studio-ousia/bpr) and did _not_ train the query and passage encoders from scratch.

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the BPR's results.

## Summary

Here's how our results stack up against results reported in the paper using the BPR model (index 2.3 GB + model 0.4 GB):

| Dataset     | Method            | Top-20 (orig) | Top-20 (us) | Top-100 (orig) | Top-100 (us) |
|:------------|:------------------|--------------:|------------:|---------------:|-------------:|
| NQ          | BPR               |          77.9 |        77.9 |           85.7 |         85.7 |
| NQ          | BPR w/o reranking |          76.5 |        76.0 |           84.9 |         85.0 |

## Natural Questions (NQ) with BPR

BPR with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.bpr-single-nq \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --encoded-queries bpr_single_nq-nq-test \
  --output runs/run.bpr.rerank.nq-test.nq.hash.trec \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16 \
  --hits 100 --binary-hits 1000 \
  --searcher bpr --rerank
```

The option `--encoded-queries` specifies the use of encoded queries (i.e., queries that have already been converted into dense vectors and cached).

To evaluate, first convert the TREC output format to DPR's `json` format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --input runs/run.bpr.rerank.nq-test.nq.hash.trec \
  --output runs/run.bpr.rerank.nq-test.nq.hash.json

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.bpr.rerank.nq-test.nq.hash.json \
  --topk 20 100
```

Results:

```
Top20  accuracy: 0.7792
Top100 accuracy: 0.8571
```

# Does Cohere Deliver a 3X Better MIRACL?

_Monday, January 16, 2023_

tl;dr &mdash; doesn't appear so... but Cohere's multilingual embeddings nevertheless yield impressive quality improvements.

On December 12, 2022, Cohere made a [splashy product announcement](https://twitter.com/CohereAI/status/1602343694010646529) about multilingual text understanding model support for 100+ languages, which claims to deliver "3X better performance than existing open-source models".
We read this with excitement, "Wow 3X!"

Wait, but 3X better what?
Does performance refer to quality? Latency? Throughput? Memory usage?
When [questioned about this](https://twitter.com/awadallah/status/1602537786111758336), it didn't seem like one of the co-founders [even understood the question](https://twitter.com/nickfrosst/status/1602538610728763392), at least initially.
Regardless, as Carl Sagan famously noted, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".
This led us to dig a bit deeper...

Based on Cohere's [blog post](https://txt.cohere.ai/multilingual/), they claimed to have "extensively benchmarked [their] new model... across a wide range of applications, domains and languages".
Among other datasets:

> We benchmarked on two datasets from BEIR, 10 datasets from Mr. Tydi, and 14 datasets from MIRACL. The benchmark consists of 16 languages from various language families and alphabets: Arabic, Bengali, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Telugu, Thai, and Vietnamese. All of these benchmarks have been created by native speakers on original text.

Hey, that's awesome!
We're the team behind the MIRACL dataset, which is a collaboration between the University of Waterloo and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, so it's great that others are using our resources.

[MIRACL](http://miracl.ai) 🌍🙌🌏 (Multilingual Information Retrieval Across a Continuum of Languages) is an [WSDM 2023 Cup challenge](https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2023/program/wsdm-cup) that focuses on search across 18 different languages, which collectively encompass over three billion native speakers around the world.
The dataset is part of a competition with a [leaderboard](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1881/overview).

Here's the graph that Cohere showed in their blog post:

![Performance Graph from Cohere Blog Post](https://txt.cohere.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/Cohere_Multilingual_Benchmark_Chart_v4.jpg)

(Let's set aside the fact that the bar chart does not have _y_ axis labels, which is a mistake for which faculty often chide their undergraduate students...)

Anyway, the results led to some head scratching... for example, what about a BM25 baseline?
Or an mDPR baseline that was explored by [Asai et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.46/) and later studied by [Zhang et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02363)?
In typical social media banter, we [prodded](https://twitter.com/lintool/status/1602399696261111808) Cohere to actually participate in our leaderboard and have their models evaluated in a fair manner, exactly the same as everyone else in the community.
The "known-languages track" comprises 16 languages, and Cohere said they evaluated on 14 of those... so should be easy, right?
We [prodded](https://twitter.com/lintool/status/1602642255415754753), [prodded some more](https://twitter.com/nandan__thakur/status/1602459567904165888), and even [offered to help](https://twitter.com/lintool/status/1603564040982241281)!

There wasn't much of a response from Cohere, which perplexed us.
Our position is simple: Anyone (researchers, companies, etc.) making claims about the effectiveness of their models in the context of a community benchmark should [back up their claims](https://twitter.com/lintool/status/1602423757573963778).
We think this position is quite reasonable, especially since one of the researchers behind Cohere's multilingual models [took OpenAI to task](https://twitter.com/Nils_Reimers/status/1487014195568775173) about GPT-3 embeddings in January 2022.
So, [we issued a challenge](https://twitter.com/lintool/status/1603401397789237251) to Cohere: either they should formally submit a run to our leaderboard, or we'll do it for them.
To be clear, that latter means that we would use their commercially available product to conduct an evaluation on a community benchmark.
Actually, that's not unlike the experience of a customer who might be evaluating Cohere's model for a multilingual search application!

Having received no further response from Cohere, we did exactly that, the results of which are posted on the [official MIRACL leaderboard](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1881/leaderboard/4427) on January 16, 2023.
We started with the official baseline BM25 results and applied embeddings from Cohere's `multilingual-22-12` model for reranking the top 100 hits, following [their instructions](https://txt.cohere.ai/multilingual/).
The submitted run is named "Cohere API (BM25-rerank)", which achieves an average nDCG@10 of **0.544** across 16 languages on the dev set, for the known-languages condition.
For reference, the BM25 baseline achieve 0.393 nDCG@10, so Cohere's multilingual embeddings were able to improve the baseline by an impressive 38%.
Not 3X, but that _does_ deserve a "wow"!
(Those of you who've worked in this space know that BM25 is a _tough_ baseline.)
For additional context, the mDPR dense retrieval model, which is another MIRACL baseline described [in the dataset overview paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09984), achieves an nDCG@10 score of 0.415 under the same setting.
Cohere improves over mDPR by a respectable 31%.
Note that both BM25 and mDPR can be characterized as "zero shot", since the mDPR model was trained on an entirely different dataset (MS MARCO).
The results can be summarized as follows:

| Method   | Avg nDCG@10 |
| -------- | ----------- |
| BM25     |   0.393     |
| mDPR     |   0.415     |
| Cohere   |   0.544     | 

Beyond effectiveness, we found the Cohere API quite easy to use and our implementation quite straightforward.
So kudos on the developer experience!

A bit more detail about our evaluation setup:
To be clear, we reranked the top-100 BM25 hits, which is a different evaluation approach than encoding the entire corpus and performing top-_k_ nearest-neighbor search.
However, we justify this approach in a few ways:

+ Reranking is far more computationally efficient than encoding the entire corpus. For MIRACL, this would have meant 16 separate corpora. We feel that our approach is actually quite realistic from the "customer perspective": reranking is an easy way to "kick the tires" on a product, to be able to get a sense of the result quality at relatively low cost.
+ Reranking gives results roughly in the same ballpark as top-_k_ nearest-neighbor search on the entire corpus, we feel, at least for the metric under consideration. Here, we are reranking the top 100 hits, and nDCG@10 considers only the top 10 hits. We have been playing with embeddings from OpenAI also, and with reranking top-100 BM25 results, we are able to replicate nDCG@10 numbers quite close to those reported in their papers. So we have some confidence about the veracity of these results. Once again, from the "customer perspective", reranking top 100 to get better top 10 seems like a realistic setup.

So, to circle all the way back to the beginning with Cohere's boasts of being able to deliver "3X better performance": in terms of nDCG@10 on the 16 languages in MIRACL on the dev set for the known languages condition, we were unable to reproduce anywhere close to the claimed gains, but our observed gains are quite impressive and real.

We're working on a paper that examines the effectiveness of public, commercially available "embedding services" (beyond Cohere, including OpenAI and others as well).
Included with the paper will be source code to reproduce all our experiments.
Unfortunately, there's this pesky publication embargo in the community... and it doesn't appear like we're going to be able to push out our code in time.
Nevertheless, we wanted to share this result (and explain the MIRACL leaderboard entry) before the gag order associated with the embargo period kicks in.
As to not violate these rules, we are unable to further comment publicly on these experiments for a few months (e.g., on social media).
However, if you wish to discuss these results with us in private, please directly reach out.

# Pyserini: DeepImpact on MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This page describes how to reproduce the DeepImpact experiments in the following paper:

> Antonio Mallia, Omar Khattab, Nicola Tonellotto, and Torsten Suel. [Learning Passage Impacts for Inverted Indexes.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3463030) _SIGIR 2021_.

Here, we start with a version of the MS MARCO passage corpus that has already been processed with DeepImpact, i.e., gone through document expansion and term reweighting.
Thus, no neural inference is involved.

## Data Prep

> You can skip the data prep and indexing steps if you use our pre-built indexes. Skip directly down to the "Retrieval" section below.

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO passage dataset with DeepImpact processing:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco-passage-deepimpact.tar -P collections/

tar xvf collections/msmarco-passage-deepimpact.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-passage-deepimpact.tar` is 3.6 GB and has MD5 checksum `fe827eb13ca3270bebe26b3f6b99f550`.

## Indexing

We can now index these docs:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage-deepimpact/ \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-deepimpact/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

The important indexing options to note here are `--impact --pretokenized`: the first tells Anserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the DeepImpact tokens.

Upon completion, we should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD (using 12 threads, per above), indexing takes around 15 minutes.

## Retrieval

> If you've skipped the data prep and indexing steps and wish to directly use our pre-built indexes, use `--index msmarco-passage-deepimpact` in the command below.

To ensure that the tokenization in the index aligns exactly with the queries, we use pre-tokenized queries, which are already included in Pyserini.
We can run retrieval as follows:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-deepimpact/ \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset-deepimpact \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage-deepimpact.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Note that the important option here is `--impact`, where we specify impact scoring.
A complete run should take around five minutes.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage-deepimpact.tsv
```

The results should be as follows:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3252764133351524
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

The final evaluation metric is very close to the one reported in the paper (0.326).

# Pyserini: Reproducing DistilBERT KD Results

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the DistilBERT KD dense retrieval model on the MS MARCO passage ranking task, described in the following paper:

> Sebastian Hofstätter, Sophia Althammer, Michael Schröder, Mete Sertkan, and Allan Hanbury. [Improving Efficient Neural Ranking Models with Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02666) arXiv:2010.02666, October 2020. 

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

Dense retrieval, with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.distilbert-dot-margin-mse-t2 \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries distilbert_kd-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-margin_mse-t2.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Replace `--encoded-queries` with `--encoder sebastian-hofstaetter/distilbert-dot-margin_mse-T2-msmarco` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-margin_mse-t2.tsv
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3251
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-margin_mse-t2.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-margin_mse-t2.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-margin_mse-t2.trec
```

Results:

```
map                     all     0.3309
recall_1000             all     0.9553

# Pyserini: Reproducing DistilBERT KD TASB Results

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the DistilBERT KD TASB dense retrieval model on the MS MARCO passage ranking task, described in the following paper:

> Sebastian Hofstätter, Sheng-Chieh Lin, Jheng-Hong Yang, Jimmy Lin, Allan Hanbury. [Efficiently Teaching an Effective Dense Retriever with Balanced Topic Aware Sampling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06967) _SIGIR 2021_.

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

Dense retrieval, with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256 \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries distilbert_tas_b-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Replace `--encoded-queries` with `--encoder sebastian-hofstaetter/distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256-msmarco` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256.tsv
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3444
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256.trec
```

Results:

```
map                     all     0.3515
recall_1000             all     0.9771
```

# Pyserini: Reproducing DKRR Results

DKRR (Distilling Knowledge from Reader to Retriever) is a technique to learn retriever models described in the following paper:

> Gautier Izacard and Edouard Grave. [Distilling Knowledge from Reader to Retriever for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04584). *arXiv:2012.04584*, 2020.

We have incorporated this work into Pyserini.
In particular, we have taken the pretrained `nq_retriever` and `tqa_retriever` models from the [DKRR repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/FiD), used them to index English Wikipedia, and then incorporate into the dense retrieval framework in Pyserini.

This guide provides instructions to reproduce our results.

## Natural Questions

Running DKRR retrieval on `dpr-nq-dev` and `nq-test` of the Natural Questions dataset:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.dkrr-nq \
  --topics dpr-nq-dev \
  --encoded-queries dkrr-dpr-nq-retriever-dpr-nq-dev \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.dev.trec \
  --query-prefix question: \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16

python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.dkrr-nq \
  --topics nq-test \
  --encoded-queries dkrr-dpr-nq-retriever-nq-test \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.test.trec \
  --query-prefix question: \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Alternatively, replace `--encoded-queries ...` with `--encoder castorini/dkrr-dpr-nq-retriever` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate, convert the TREC output format to DPR's json format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics dpr-nq-dev \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.dev.trec \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.dev.json

python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics nq-test \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.test.trec \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.test.json
```

Evaluating:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.dev.json \
  --topk 5 20 100 500 1000

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.dpr-dkrr-nq.test.json \
  --topk 5 20 100 500 1000
```

The expected results are as follows, shown in the "ours" column:

| Metric   | `dpr-nq-dev` (ours) | `dpr-nq-dev` (orig) | `nq-test` (ours) |
|:---------|--------------------:|--------------------:|-----------------:|
| Top-5    |               72.40 |                     |            73.80 | 
| Top-20   |               82.36 |                82.4 |            84.27 |
| Top-100  |               87.87 |                87.9 |            89.34 |
| Top-500  |               90.37 |                     |            92.24 |
| Top-1000 |               91.30 |                     |            93.43 |

For reference, reported results from the paper (Table 8) are shown in the "orig" column.

## TriviaQA (TQA)

Running DKRR retrieval on `dpr-trivia-dev` and `dpr-trivia-test` of the TriviaQA dataset:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.dkrr-tqa \
  --topics dpr-trivia-dev \
  --encoded-queries dkrr-dpr-tqa-retriever-dpr-tqa-dev \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.dev.trec \
  --query-prefix question: \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16

python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.dkrr-tqa \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --encoded-queries dkrr-dpr-tqa-retriever-dpr-tqa-test \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.test.trec \
  --query-prefix question: \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```
Alternatively, replace `--encoded-queries ...` with `--encoder castorini/dkrr-dpr-tqa-retriever` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate, convert the TREC output format to DPR's json format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics dpr-trivia-dev \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.dev.trec \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.dev.json

python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.test.trec \
  --output runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.test.json
```

Evaluating:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.dev.json \
  --topk 5 20 100 500 1000

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.dpr-dkrr-trivia.test.json \
  --topk 5 20 100 500 1000
```

The expected results are as follows, shown in the "ours" column:

| Metric   | `dpr-trivia-dev` (ours) | `dpr-trivia-dev` (orig) | `dpr-trivia-test` (ours) |
|:---------|------------------------:|------------------------:|-------------------------:|
| Top-5    |                   77.31 |                         |                    77.23 |
| Top-20   |                   83.63 |                    83.5 |                    83.74 |

# Pyserini: Reproducing DPR Results

Dense passage retriever (DPR) is a dense retrieval method described in the following paper:

> Vladimir Karpukhin, Barlas Oğuz, Sewon Min, Patrick Lewis, Ledell Wu, Sergey Edunov, Danqi Chen, Wen-tau Yih. [Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.550/). _Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)_, pages 6769-6781, 2020.

We have replicated DPR results and incorporated the technique into Pyserini.
Our own efforts are described in the following paper:

> Xueguang Ma, Kai Sun, Ronak Pradeep, Minghan Li, and Jimmy Lin. [Another Look at DPR: Reproduction of Training and Replication of Retrieval](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-99736-6_41). Proceedings of the 44th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2022), Part I, pages 613-626, April 2021, Stavanger, Norway.

Which evolved from a previous arXiv preprint:

> Xueguang Ma, Kai Sun, Ronak Pradeep, and Jimmy Lin. [A Replication Study of Dense Passage Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05740). _arXiv:2104.05740_, April 2021. 

To be clear, we started with model checkpoint releases in the official [DPR repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR) and did _not_ retrain the query and passage encoders from scratch.
Our implementation does not share any code with the DPR repo, other than evaluation scripts to ensure that results are comparable.

This guide provides instructions to reproduce our replication study.
Our efforts include both retrieval and end-to-end answer extraction, but we only cover retrieval here.

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

## Summary

Here's how our results stack up against results reported in the paper using the DPR-Multi model:

Note that the results below represent the current state of the code base, where there may be minor differences in effectiveness from what's reported in the paper.

## Natural Questions (NQ) with DPR-Multi

**DPR retrieval** with brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.dpr-multi \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --encoded-queries dpr_multi-nq-test \
  --output runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.trec \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

The option `--encoded-queries` specifies the use of encoded queries (i.e., queries that have already been converted into dense vectors and cached).
As an alternative, replace with `--encoder facebook/dpr-question_encoder-multiset-base` to perform "on-the-fly" query encoding, i.e., convert text queries into dense vectors as part of the dense retrieval process.

To evaluate, first convert the TREC output format to DPR's `json` format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --input runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.trec \
  --output runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.json

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.json \
  --topk 20 100
```

And the expected results:

```
Top20  accuracy: 0.7947
Top100 accuracy: 0.8609
```

**BM25 retrieval**:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --output runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.bm25.trec
```

To evaluate, first convert the TREC output format to DPR's `json` format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --input runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.bm25.trec \
  --output runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.bm25.json

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.bm25.json \
  --topk 20 100
```

And the expected results:

```
Top20  accuracy: 0.6299
Top100 accuracy: 0.7823
```

**Hybrid dense-sparse retrieval** (combining above two approaches):

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.hybrid \
  dense  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w.dpr-multi \
         --encoded-queries dpr_multi-nq-test \
  sparse --index wikipedia-dpr-100w \
  fusion --alpha 1.3 \
  run    --topics dpr-nq-test \
         --output runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.bm25.trec \
         --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Same as above, replace `--encoded-queries` with `--encoder facebook/dpr-question_encoder-multiset-base` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate, first convert the TREC output format to DPR's `json` format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --index wikipedia-dpr-100w \
  --topics dpr-nq-test \
  --input runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.bm25.trec \
  --output runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.bm25.json

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.encoded.dpr.nq-test.multi.bm25.json \
  --topk 20 100
```

And the expected results:

# Pyserini: Multi-field Baseline for MS MARCO Document Ranking

<!-- NOTE, don't rename this page, because the URL is embedded in the WSDM demo -->

This page contains instructions for reproducing the "Elasticsearch optimized
multi_match best_fields" entry (2020/11/25) on the the [MS MARCO Document Ranking Leaderboard](https://microsoft.github.io/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking-Submissions/leaderboard/) using Pyserini.
Details behind this run are described in this [blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/improving-search-relevance-with-data-driven-query-optimization);
the official leaderboard submission corresponds to the run denoted "multi_match best_fields tuned (all-in-one): all
params" in the blog post.

This run makes sure to preserve the distinction between document fields when
preparing and indexing documents. For ranking, we use a disjunction max query to
combine score contributions across fields; the weights for the disjunction max
query are taken from the blog post reference above.

To match the leaderboard results, this run makes use of a custom stopwords file
[`elastic-msmarco-stopwords.txt`](elastic-msmarco-stopwords.txt). The file contains the default English stopwords
from Lucene, plus some additional words targeted at question-style queries.

## Data Prep

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO document dataset:

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-doc
wget https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/msmarco-docs.tsv.gz -P collections/msmarco-doc

# Alternative mirror:
# wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/zly8cbyvt18l3u0/msmarco-docs.tsv.gz -P collections/msmarco-doc

gunzip collections/msmarco-doc/msmarco-docs.tsv.gz
```

To confirm, `msmarco-docs.tsv.gz` should have an MD5 checksum of `103b19e21ad324d8a5f1ab562425c0b4`.

First we need to convert the file to JSON lines format. Each document will
correspond to a JSON object with distinct fields for title, URL, and body:

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_doc_collection_to_jsonl.py \
  --collection-path collections/msmarco-doc/msmarco-docs.tsv \
  --output-folder collections/msmarco-doc-json
```

We then build the index with the following command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index \
  --input collections/msmarco-doc-json/ \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --index indexes/msmarco-doc/lucene-index-msmarco \
  --threads 4 \
  --fields title url \
  --storeRaw \
  --stopwords docs/elastic-msmarco-stopwords.txt
```

On a modern desktop with an SSD, indexing takes around 15 minutes.
There should be a total of 3,201,821 documents indexed.

## Performing Retrieval on the Dev Queries

After indexing finishes, we can do a retrieval run. A few minor details to pay
attention to: the official metric is MRR@100, so we want to only return the top
100 hits, and the submission files to the leaderboard have a slightly different
format.

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --index indexes/msmarco-doc/lucene-index-msmarco/ \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.leaderboard-dev.elastic.txt \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --hits 100 \
  --bm25 --k1 1.2 --b 0.75 \
  --fields contents=10.0 title=8.63280262513067 url=0.0 \
  --dismax --dismax.tiebreaker 0.3936135232328522 \
  --stopwords docs/elastic-msmarco-stopwords.txt
```

After the run completes, we can evaluate the results:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_doc_eval \
    --judgments msmarco-doc-dev \
    --run runs/run.msmarco-doc.leaderboard-dev.elastic.txt

# Pyserini: GAR-T5 enhanced retrieval for NQ and TriviaQA

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the search results of our GAR-T5 model which takes inspiration from the following paper:
> Mao, Y., He, P., Liu, X., Shen, Y., Gao, J., Han, J., & Chen, W. (2020). [Generation-augmented retrieval for open-domain question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08553). arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.08553.

## GAR-T5 enhanced retrieval evaluation
### Method 1: Using prebuilt topics
```bash
python -m pyserini.search \
  --topics <dpr-trivia or nq>-test-gar-t5-<answers, titles, sentences, or all> \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --output runs/gar-t5-run.trec \
  --batch-size 70 \
  --threads 70


python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics <nq-test, nq-dev, dpr-trivia-dev or dpr-trivia-test> \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/gar-t5-run.trec \
  --output runs/gar-t5-run.json
```

### Method 2: Interacting with Gar-T5 Predictions
**Get the Dataset as tsv**  
With the command below, we download the GAR-T5 predictions and augment the topics ([TriviaQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/castorini/triviaqa_gar-t5_expansions) and [NaturalQuestion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/castorini/nq_gar-t5_expansions))

```bash
export ANSERINI=<path to anserini>
python scripts/gar/query_augmentation_tsv.py \
  --dataset <nq or trivia> \
  --data_split <validation or test> \
  --output_path <default is augmented_topics.tsv> \
  --sentences <optional> \
  --titles <optional> \
  --answers <optional>
```

Running retrieval

```bash
python -m pyserini.search \
  --topics <path to your topic files> \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --output runs/gar-t5-run.trec \
  --batch-size 70 \
  --threads 70


python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics <nq-test, nq-dev, dpr-trivia-dev or dpr-trivia-test> \
  --index wikipedia-dpr \
  --input runs/gar-t5-run.trec \
  --output runs/gar-t5-run.json
```
  
The rest of the section should be the same for both methods

---
To run fusion RRF, you will need all three (answers, titles, sentences) trec files
```bash
python -m pyserini.fusion \
  --runs <path to answers.trec> <path to sentences.trec> <path to titles.trec> \
  --output <output path fusion.trec>
```

To evaluate the run:
```
python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/gar-t5-run.json \
  --topk 1 5 10 20 50 100 200 300 500 1000
```

This should give you the topk scores as below

# Pyserini Regressions: BM25 Baselines for HC4 on NeuCLIR22

This page documents BM25 regression experiments for HC4 (v1.0) on the [NeuCLIR22 corpus](https://neuclir.github.io/).
The HC4 qrels have been filtered down to include only those in the intersection of the HC4 and NeuCLIR22 corpora.


## Corpus Download

### 1. Manual Download

The HC4 corpus can be downloaded following the instructions [here](https://github.com/NeuCLIR/download-collection.git).
After download, verify that all and only specified documents have been downloaded by running the code 
[provided here](https://github.com/NeuCLIR/download-collection#postprocessing-of-the-downloaded-documents).

With the corpus downloaded, we need to create 3 separate folders for the 3 languages (Persian, Chinese and  Russian) ,
and unpack the data into the respective folders for each language


```bash
mkdir collections/neuclir22-fa collections/neuclir22-zh collections/neuclir22-ru
```

We can now index these docs as a `NeuClirCollection` using Anserini bindings from Pyserini

```bash

python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection NeuClirCollection \
  --input collections/neuclir22-zh --index indexes/lucene-index.neuclir22-zh \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 8 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw -language zh \
  >& logs/log.neuclir22-zh &

python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection NeuClirCollection \
  --input collections/neuclir22-fa --index indexes/lucene-index.neuclir22-fa \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 8 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw -language fa \
  >& logs/log.neuclir22-fa &

python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection NeuClirCollection \
  --input collections/neuclir22-ru --index indexes/lucene-index.neuclir22-ru \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 8 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw -language ru \
  >& logs/log.neuclir22-ru &
```

# Pyserini Regressions: BM25 Baselines for HC4 (v1.0)

This guide contains instructions for running BM25 baselines on [HC4 (v1.0)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09992.pdf).

## Corpus Download

### 1. Manual Download

The HC4 corpus can be downloaded following the instructions [here](https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4).
After download, verify that all and only specified documents have been downloaded by running the code 
[provided here](https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4#postprocessing-of-the-downloaded-documents).

With the corpus downloaded, we need to create 3 separate folders for the 3 languages (Persian, Chinese and  Russian) ,
and unpack the data into the respective folders for each language


```bash
mkdir collections/hc4-v1.0-fa collections/hc4-v1.0-zh collections/hc4-v1.0-ru
```

We can now index these docs as a `NeuClirCollection`  using Anserini bindings from Pyserini

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection NeuClirCollection \
  --input collections/hc4-v1.0-zh --index indexes/lucene-index.hc4-v1.0-zh \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 8 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw -language zh \
  >& logs/log.hc4-v1.0-zh &

python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection NeuClirCollection \
  --input collections/hc4-v1.0-fa --index indexes/lucene-index.hc4-v1.0-fa \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 8 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw -language fa \
  >& logs/log.hc4-v1.0-fa &

python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection NeuClirCollection \
  --input collections/hc4-v1.0-ru --index indexes/lucene-index.hc4-v1.0-ru \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 8 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw -language ru \
  >& logs/log.hc4-v1.0-ru &
```

# Pyserini: BM25 Baselines for KILT

The guide describes reproducing competitive BM25 baselinse for [KILT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/KILT): a benchmark for Knowledge Intensive Language Tasks.

**Note**: this guide requires ~100 GB of disk space available, since we will be working with snapshots of Wikipedia.

## Set Up Environment

Do the following:

```bash
# Create a virtual env
conda create -n kilt37 -y python=3.7 && conda activate kilt37

# Get the development installation of pyserini

```

## Index the Corpus

Convert to passage or document level JSONL format indexable by Pyserini. You can inspect the individual nohup output files using `tail -f <file>`:

### Document-Level Sources

```bash
mkdir pyserini/collections/kilt_document
for filename in pyserini/collections/kilt_knowledge_split/kilt_ks.??; do
    [ -e "$filename" ] || continue
    nohup python pyserini/scripts/kilt/convert_kilt_to_document_jsonl.py \
        --input "$filename" \
        --output pyserini/collections/kilt_document/$(basename "$filename") \
        --flen 500000 \
        > nohup_$(basename "$filename").out &
done

# Once it's done, convert back into 1 file:
cat pyserini/collections/kilt_document/kilt_ks.?? > pyserini/collections/kilt_document/dump.jsonl
rm pyserini/collections/kilt_document/kilt_ks.??
# Sanity check (should give the same # of lines):
wc -l pyserini/collections/kilt_knowledgesource.json
wc -l pyserini/collections/kilt_document/dump.jsonl

# Finally, index into Anserini (about 1hr):
nohup python -m pyserini.index -collection JsonCollection -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
 -threads 40 -input pyserini/collections/kilt_document/ \
 -index pyserini/indexes/kilt_document -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeContents &
```

### Passage-Level Sources

```bash
mkdir pyserini/collections/kilt_passage
for filename in pyserini/collections/kilt_knowledge_split/kilt_ks.??; do
    [ -e "$filename" ] || continue
    nohup python pyserini/scripts/kilt/convert_kilt_to_passage_jsonl.py \
        --input "$filename" \
        --output pyserini/collections/kilt_passage/$(basename "$filename") \
        --sections --bigrams --stem \
        --flen 500000 \
        > nohup_$(basename "$filename").out &
done

# Once it's done, convert back into 1 file:
cat pyserini/collections/kilt_passage/kilt_ks.?? > pyserini/collections/kilt_passage/dump.jsonl
rm pyserini/collections/kilt_passage/kilt_ks.??

# Finally, index into Anserini (about 1hr):
nohup python -m pyserini.index -collection JsonCollection -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
 -threads 40 -input pyserini/collections/kilt_passage/ \
 -index pyserini/indexes/kilt_passage -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeContents &
``` 

## Create Baseline Runs

Compute a run for a given index. Tasks can be configured using `--config`. You can increase the number of threads, but you may encounter OOM issues. I find that 8-20 is usually a good amount. This will take a 1-2 hours.

```bash
nohup python pyserini/scripts/kilt/run_retrieval.py \
 --config pyserini/scripts/kilt/dev_data.json \
 --index_dir pyserini/indexes/kilt_document \
 --output_dir pyserini/runs \
 --threads 8 \
 --topk 1000 \
 --name kilt_document &

```

You can use `kilt_passage` instead to run retrieval using the passage-level index.

## Evaluate

```bash
# Evaluate runs (takes a few minutes if you used topk 1000)
nohup ./pyserini/scripts/kilt/eval_runs.sh pyserini/runs/kilt_document 1,100,1000 > results.out &
```
You can use `kilt_passage` instead to run evaluation using the passage-level run.

## Results

Your results should look like this:

# Pyserini: LTR Filtering for MS MARCO Document

❗ Code associated with these experiments was removed in commit [`a65b96`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/a65b9687a91d1ba0f754445ab0e93dd7116c619f).
This page is preserved only for archival purposes.

This page describes how to reproduce the ltr experiments in the following paper:

> Yue Zhang, Chengcheng Hu, Yuqi Liu, Hui Fang, and Jimmy Lin. [Learning to Rank in the Age of Muppets: Effectiveness–Efficiency Tradeoffs in Multi-Stage Ranking](https://aclanthology.org/2021.sustainlp-1.8) _Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Simple and Efficient Natural Language Processing_, pages 64–73, 2021.

This guide contains instructions for running learning-to-rank baseline on the [MS MARCO *document* reranking task](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/).
Learning-to-rank serves as a second stage-reranker after BM25 retrieval; we use a sliding window and MaxP strategy here.

## Performing Retrieval

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory. 

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-ltr-document
```

Download our already trained IBM model:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/pyserini-models/model-ltr-ibm.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-ltr-document/
tar -xzvf collections/msmarco-ltr-document/model-ltr-ibm.tar.gz -C collections/msmarco-ltr-document/
```

Download our already trained LTR model:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/pyserini-models/model-ltr-msmarco-passage-mrr-v1.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-ltr-document/
tar -xzvf collections/msmarco-ltr-document/model-ltr-msmarco-passage-mrr-v1.tar.gz -C collections/msmarco-ltr-document/
```

Now, we have all things ready and can run inference:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.ltr \
  --index msmarco-doc-per-passage-ltr \
  --model collections/msmarco-ltr-document/msmarco-passage-ltr-mrr-v1 \
  --ibm-model collections/msmarco-ltr-document/ibm_model/ \
  --topic tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
  --qrel tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
  --output runs/run.ltr.msmarco-doc.tsv \
  --granularity document \
  --max-passage --hits 10000
```

Note that internally, retrieval depends on tokenization with spaCy; our implementation currently depends on v3.2.1 (this is potentially important as tokenization might change from version to version).

After the run finishes, we can evaluate the results using the official MS MARCO evaluation script:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_doc_eval \
    --judgments msmarco-doc-dev \
    --run runs/run.ltr.msmarco-doc.tsv

#####################
MRR @100: 0.31088730804779396
QueriesRanked: 5193
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool, `trec_eval`, to compute metrics other than MRR@10.
For that we first need to convert the run file into TREC format:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
    --input runs/run.ltr.msmarco-doc.tsv --output runs/run.ltr.msmarco-doc.trec
```

And then run the `trec_eval` tool:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap \
    msmarco-doc-dev runs/run.ltr.msmarco-doc.trec

map                   	all	0.3109
recall_1000           	all	0.9268
```

## Building the Index from Scratch

First, we need to download the collection:

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-doc
wget https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/doc2query-data/raw/master/T5-doc/msmarco-docs.tsv.gz -P collections/msmarco-doc
wget https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/doc2query-data/raw/master/T5-doc/msmarco_doc_passage_ids.txt -P collections/msmarco-doc
```

We will need to generate the collection of passage segments.
Here, we use segment size 3 and stride 1, and then append fields for LTR pipeline.

```bash
python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_msmarco_passage_doc_to_anserini.py \
  --original_docs_path collections/msmarco-doc/msmarco-docs.tsv.gz \
  --doc_ids_path collections/msmarco-doc/msmarco_doc_passage_ids.txt \
  --output_docs_path collections/msmarco-doc/msmarco_pass_doc.jsonl

python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_passage_doc.py \
  --input collections/msmarco-doc/msmarco_pass_doc.jsonl \
  --output collections/msmarco-ltr-document/ltr_msmarco_pass_doc.json \
  --proc_qty 10
```

The above script will convert the collection and queries to json files with `text_unlemm`, `analyzed`, `text_bert_tok` and `raw` fields.
Note that the tokenization script depends on spaCy; our implementation currently depends on v3.2.1 (this is potentially important as tokenization might change from version to version).
Next, we need to convert the MS MARCO json collection into Anserini's jsonl files (which have one json object per line):

```bash
python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_collection_to_jsonl.py \
  --collection-path collections/msmarco-ltr-document/ltr_msmarco_pass_doc.json \
  --output-folder collections/msmarco-ltr-document/ltr_msmarco_pass_doc_jsonl  
```

We can now index these docs as a `JsonCollection` using Anserini with pretokenized option:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-ltr-document/ltr_msmarco_pass_doc_jsonl \
  --index indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-doc-per-passage-ltr \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 21 \
  -storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw --pretokenized
```

Note that the `--pretokenized` option pretokenized tells Pyserini to use the whitespace analyzer so preserve the existing tokenization.

# Pyserini: LTR Filtering for MS MARCO Passage

❗ Code associated with these experiments was removed in commit [`a65b96`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/a65b9687a91d1ba0f754445ab0e93dd7116c619f).
This page is preserved only for archival purposes.

This page describes how to reproduce the learning-to-rank (LTR) experiments in the following paper:

> Yue Zhang, Chengcheng Hu, Yuqi Liu, Hui Fang, and Jimmy Lin. [Learning to Rank in the Age of Muppets: Effectiveness–Efficiency Tradeoffs in Multi-Stage Ranking](https://aclanthology.org/2021.sustainlp-1.8) _Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Simple and Efficient Natural Language Processing_, pages 64–73, 2021.

This guide contains instructions for running the LTR baseline on the [MS MARCO *passage* reranking task](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/).
LTR serves as a second-stage reranker after BM25 retrieval.

## Performing Retrieval

We're going to use root as the working directory.

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-ltr-passage
```

Download our already trained IBM model:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/pyserini-models/model-ltr-ibm.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/
tar -xzvf collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/model-ltr-ibm.tar.gz -C collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/
```

Download our already trained LTR model:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/pyserini-models/model-ltr-msmarco-passage-mrr-v1.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-ltr-passage
tar -xzvf collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/model-ltr-msmarco-passage-mrr-v1.tar.gz -C collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/
```

The following command generates our reranking result with our prebuilt index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.ltr \
  --index msmarco-passage-ltr \
  --model collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/msmarco-passage-ltr-mrr-v1 \
  --ibm-model collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/ibm_model/ \
  --topic tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.txt \
  --qrel tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.txt \
  --output runs/run.ltr.msmarco-passage.tsv
```

Inference speed will vary; on our `orca` machine, the run takes about half an hour to complete.
Note that internally, retrieval depends on tokenization with spaCy; our implementation currently depends on v3.2.1 (this is potentially important as tokenization might change from version to version).

Here, our model was trained to maximize MRR@10.
We can also train other models from scratch, following the [training guide](experiments-ltr-msmarco-passage-training.md), and replace the `--model` argument with the newly trained model directory.

After the run finishes, we can evaluate the results using the official MS MARCO evaluation script:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
    runs/run.ltr.msmarco-passage.tsv

#####################
MRR @10: 0.24723580979669724
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool, `trec_eval`, to compute metrics other than MRR@10.
For that we first need to convert the run file into TREC format:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
    --input runs/run.ltr.msmarco-passage.tsv --output runs/run.ltr.msmarco-passage.trec
```

And then run the `trec_eval` tool:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap \
    msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.ltr.msmarco-passage.trec

map                   	all	0.2552
recall_1000           	all	0.8573
```

Average precision or AP (also called mean average precision, MAP) and recall@1000 (recall at rank 1000) are the two metrics we care about the most.
AP captures aspects of both precision and recall in a single metric, and is the most common metric used by information retrieval researchers.
On the other hand, recall@1000 provides the upper bound effectiveness of downstream reranking modules (i.e., rerankers are useless if there isn't a relevant document in the results).

## Building the Index from Scratch

To build an index from scratch, we need to preprocess the collection:

First, download the MS MACRO passage dataset `collectionandqueries.tar.gz`, per instructions [here](experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

```bash
python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_passage.py \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage/collection.tsv \
  --output collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/ltr_collection.json
```

The above script will convert the collection to JSON files with `text_unlemm`, `analyzed`, `text_bert_tok` and `raw` fields.
Note that the tokenization script depends on spaCy; our implementation currently depends on v3.2.1 (this is potentially important as tokenization might change from version to version).
Next, we need to convert the MS MARCO JSON collection into Anserini's JSONL format:

```bash
python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_collection_to_jsonl.py \
  --collection-path collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/ltr_collection.json \
  --output-folder collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/ltr_collection_jsonl
```

The above script should generate nine JSONL files in `collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/ltr_collection_jsonl`, each with 1M lines (except for the last one, which should have 841,823 lines).

We can now index these docs as a `JsonCollection`:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/ltr_collection_jsonl \
  --index indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-passage-ltr \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 9 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw --pretokenized
```

Note that the `--pretokenized` option pretokenized tells Pyserini to use the whitespace analyzer so preserve the existing tokenization.

# Pyserini: Train Learning-To-Rank Reranking Models for MS MARCO Passage

❗ Code associated with these experiments was removed in commit [`a65b96`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/a65b9687a91d1ba0f754445ab0e93dd7116c619f).
This page is preserved only for archival purposes.

## Data Preprocessing

Please first follow the [Pyserini BM25 retrieval guide](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) to obtain our reranking candidate.

```bash
wget https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/qidpidtriples.train.full.2.tsv.gz -P collections/msmarco-passage/	
gzip -d collections/msmarco-passage/qidpidtriples.train.full.2.tsv.gz
```
Then, download the file which has training triples and uncompress it.

Next, we're going to use `collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/` as the working directory to download pre processed data.

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/

python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_queries.py \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage/queries.eval.small.tsv \
  --output collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/queries.eval.small.json 

python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_queries.py \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage/queries.dev.small.tsv \
  --output collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/queries.dev.small.json

python scripts/ltr_msmarco/convert_queries.py \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage/queries.train.tsv \
  --output collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/queries.train.json
```

The above scripts convert queries to json objects with `text`, `text_unlemm`, `raw`, and `text_bert_tok` fields.
The first two scripts take ~1 min and the third one is a bit longer (~1.5h).

```bash
python -c "from pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher; SimpleSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-passage-ltr')"
```

We run the above commands to obtain pre-built index in cache. 

Note you can also build index from scratch follow [this guide](./experiments-ltr-msmarco-passage-reranking.md#L104).

Download pretrained IBM models
```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/pyserini-models/model-ltr-ibm.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/
tar -xzvf collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/model-ltr-ibm.tar.gz -C collections/msmarco-ltr-passage/
```

## Training the Model From Scratch
```bash
python scripts/ltr_msmarco/train_ltr_model.py  \
 --index ~/.cache/pyserini/indexes/index-msmarco-passage-ltr-20210519-e25e33f.a5de642c268ac1ed5892c069bdc29ae3 
```

Compare texts at the bottom of the output with texts below for a quick sanity check.
```
recall@10:0.48367956064947465
recall@20:0.5796442215854822
recall@50:0.683966093600764
recall@100:0.7545964660936009
recall@200:0.8033428844317098
recall@500:0.8454512893982808
recall@1000:0.8573424068767909
Total training time: XXXX s
Done!
```

Note that the number may vary due to the randomness of LambdaRank. As long as your outputs are around those values, your training is done correctly.

The training script will train a model at `runs/` with your running date in the file name. You can use this as the `--model` parameter for [reranking](experiments-ltr-msmarco-passage-reranking.md#L58).

Number of negative samples used in training can be changed by `--neg-sample`, by default is 10.

## Change the Optmization Goal of Your Trained Model
The script trains a model which optimizes MRR@10 by default. 

You can change the `mrr_at_10`  of [this function](../scripts/ltr_msmarco/train_ltr_model.py#L621) and [here](../scripts/ltr_msmarco/train_ltr_model.py#L358) to `recall_at_20` to train a model which optimizes recall@20.

You can also self defined a function format like [this](../scripts/ltr_msmarco/train_ltr_model.py#L300) and change corresponding places mentioned above to have different optimization goal.

# Pyserini: Evaluating M-BEIR Dataset with UniIR Models

This guide contains instructions for running baselines on the CIRR dataset (one of the M-BEIR datasets) and document test collections with UniIR ClipSF model from the following paper:

> Cong Wei, Yang Chen, Haonan Chen, Hexiang Hu, Ge Zhang, Jie Fu, Alan Ritter, and Wenhu Chen. [UniIR : Training and Benchmarking Universal Multimodal Information Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2311.17136_.

## Data Prep
 
First, download the CIRR dataset from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/blob/main/cand_pool/local/mbeir_cirr_task7_cand_pool.jsonl) to the `collections/m-beir/CIRR` folder inside pyserini.

```bash

wget -O collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_cand_pool.jsonl \
  "https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/resolve/main/cand_pool/local/mbeir_cirr_task7_cand_pool.jsonl"
```

Then, download the 4 parts of the image dataset from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/tree/main), merge them into 1 tar.gz file and extract it by following the specified [instructions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/blob/main/README.md#downloading-the-m-beir-dataset). Make sure the extracted folder is in the same directory as the mbeir_cirr_task7_cand_pool.jsonl file.

Finally, download the [topics](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/blob/main/query/test/mbeir_cirr_task7_test.jsonl) file and the [qrels](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/blob/main/qrels/test/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_qrels.txt) file to the same directory as well.

```bash
wget -O collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_topics.jsonl \
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/resolve/main/query/test/mbeir_cirr_task7_test.jsonl"
wget -O collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_qrels.txt \
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/resolve/main/qrels/test/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_qrels.txt"
```

**Downloading and running the full M-BEIR dataset:**
Run `python scripts/m-beir/download_all_datasets` and then run `./scripts/m-beir/fix_qrels`

IMPORTANT: To run the script, male sure `huggingface_hub` is installed and make sure the extracted images folder is in the same directory as the rest of the datasets files.

## Passage Collection

To run UniIR models, you must first make sure you have properly set up pyserini, follow the installation guide's optional section if you haven't.

To encode the corpus, use the following command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.encode \
  input --corpus collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_cand_pool.jsonl \
        --fields img_path modality txt did \
        --docid-field did \
  output --embeddings encode/m-beir-cirr_task7.clip-sf-large \
  encoder --encoder clip_sf_large \
          --encoder-class uniir \
          --device cuda:1 \
          --fp16 \
          --multimodal \
          --fields img_path modality txt did
```

To index the embeddings with FAISS, run:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.faiss \
    --input encode/m-beir-cirr_task7.clip-sf-large \
    --output indexes/m-beir-cirr_task7.clip-sf-large \
    --metric inner
```

The above index should be ~64 MB.

Perform a run on the test queries without instructions:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
    --encoder-class uniir \
    --encoder clip_sf_large \
    --topics-format mbeir \
    --topics collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_topics.jsonl \
    --index indexes/m-beir-cirr_task7.clip-sf-large \
    --output runs/run.m-beir-cirr_task7.clip-sf-large.txt \
    --fp16 \
    --hits 1000 \
    --threads 16 # Adjust based on your hardware.
```

If you want to use UniIR with M-BEIR query instructions, download it from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/blob/main/instructions/query_instructions.tsv)
Then, create a yaml file like this:

```bash
wget -O collections/m-beir/query_instructions.tsv \
"https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/M-BEIR/resolve/main/instructions/query_instructions.tsv"
```

```yaml
instruction_file: collections/m-beir/query_instructions.tsv
candidate_modality: image
dataset_id: 8 # the id for CIRR is 8
randomize_instructions: False # When False, always gets the first available instruction for each query. Set it to true if you want to use instructions at the random indexes.
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
    --encoder-class uniir \
    --encoder clip_sf_large \
    --topics-format mbeir \
    --topics collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_topics.jsonl \
    --index indexes/m-beir-cirr_task7.clip-sf-large \
    --output runs/run.m-beir-cirr_task7.instr.clip-sf-large.txt \
    --instruction-config /path/to/instruction_config.yaml \
    --fp16 \
    --hits 1000 \
    --threads 16 # Adjust based on your hardware.
```

Evaluation:

First we will need to fix the qrels file to proper TREC format so it is compatible with pyserini's trec_eval:

```bash
cut -d' ' -f1-4 collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_qrels.txt \
    > collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_qrels_fixed.txt
```

_Without instructions_

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.5 collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_qrels_fixed.txt runs/run.m-beir-cirr_task7.clip-sf-large.txt

Results:
recall_5           	all	0.3879
```

_With instructions_

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.5 collections/m-beir/CIRR/mbeir_cirr_task7_test_qrels_fixed.txt runs/run.m-beir-cirr_task7.instr.clip-sf-large.txt

Results:
recall_5           	all	0.4519
```

# Pyserini Regressions: BM25 Baselines for MIRACL (v1.0)

This guide contains instructions for running BM25 baselines on [MIRACL (v1.0)](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl).

## Corpus Download

### 1. Manual Download

The MIRACL corpus can be downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/miracl/miracl-corpus).

We can now index the documents for each language as a `MrTyDiCollection`  using Anserini bindings from Pyserini

```bash
lang=ar

python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection MrTyDiCollection \
  --input /path/to/miracl-v1.0-${lang} \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.miracl-v1.0-${lang} \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 8 --storePositions --storeDocvectors \
  --storeRaw -language ${lang} \
  >& logs/log.miracl-v1.0-${lang} &
```

# Pyserini: BM25 Baseline for MS MARCO Document Ranking

This guide contains instructions for running BM25 baselines on the [MS MARCO *document* ranking task](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/), which is nearly identical to a [similar guide in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-doc.md), except that everything is in Python here (no Java).
Note that there is a separate guide for the [MS MARCO *passage* ranking task](experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

As of July 2023, this exercise has been removed from the Waterloo students [onboarding path](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ura.md), which [starts here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md).

## Data Prep

The guide requires the [development installation](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation) for additional resource that are not shipped with the Python module.

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO document dataset:

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-doc
wget https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/msmarco-docs.trec.gz -P collections/msmarco-doc

# Alternative mirror:
# wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6caao3sfx9nluo/msmarco-docs.trec.gz -P collections/msmarco-doc
```

To confirm, `msmarco-docs.trec.gz` should have MD5 checksum of `d4863e4f342982b51b9a8fc668b2d0c0`.

There's no need to uncompress the file, as Pyserini can directly index gzipped files.
Build the index with the following command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection CleanTrecCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-doc \
  --index indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-doc \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 1 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw
```

On a modern desktop with an SSD, indexing takes around 40 minutes.
There should be a total of 3,213,835 documents indexed.

## Performing Retrieval on the Dev Queries

The 5193 queries in the development set are already stored in the repo.
Let's take a peek:

```bash
$ head tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.txt
174249	does xpress bet charge to deposit money in your account
320792	how much is a cost to run disneyland
1090270	botulinum definition
1101279	do physicians pay for insurance from their salaries?
201376	here there be dragons comic
54544	blood diseases that are sexually transmitted
118457	define bona fides
178627	effects of detox juice cleanse
1101278	do prince harry and william have last names
68095	can hives be a sign of pregnancy

$ wc tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.txt
    5193   35787  220304 tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.txt
```

Each line contains a tab-delimited (query id, query) pair.
Conveniently, Pyserini already knows how to load and iterate through these pairs.
We can now perform retrieval using these queries:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-doc \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25tuned.txt \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --hits 100 \
  --bm25 --k1 4.46 --b 0.82
```

Here, we set the BM25 parameters to `k1=4.46`, `b=0.82` (tuned by grid search).
The option `--output-format msmarco` says to generate output in the MS MARCO output format.
The option `--hits` specifies the number of documents to return per query.
Note that for the [MS MARCO Document Ranking Leaderboard](https://microsoft.github.io/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking-Submissions/leaderboard/), the official metric is MRR@100, so submissions should only return 100 hits per query. 

Retrieval speed will vary by hardware:
On a reasonably modern CPU with an SSD, we might get around 18 qps (queries per second), and so the entire run should finish in under five minutes (using a single thread).
We can perform multi-threaded retrieval by using the `--threads` and `--batch-size` arguments.
For example, setting `--threads 16 --batch-size 64` on a CPU with sufficient cores, the entire run will finish in under a minute.

After the run finishes, we can evaluate the results using the official MS MARCO evaluation script:

```bash
$ python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_doc_eval.py \
    --judgments tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
    --run runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25tuned.txt

#####################
MRR @100: 0.2770296928568702
QueriesRanked: 5193
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool, `trec_eval`, to compute metrics other than MRR@100.
For that we first need to convert the run file into TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25tuned.txt \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25tuned.trec
```

And then run the `trec_eval` tool:

```bash
$ tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -mrecall.100 -mmap \
   tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-doc.dev.txt runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25tuned.trec

map                   	all	0.2770
recall_100            	all	0.8076
```

Let's compare to the baseline provided by Microsoft.
First, download:

```bash
wget https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/msmarco-docdev-top100.gz -P runs
gunzip runs/msmarco-docdev-top100.gz
```

Then, run `trec_eval` to compare:

```bash
$ tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -mrecall.100 -mmap \
   tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-doc.dev.txt runs/msmarco-docdev-top100

map                   	all	0.2219
recall_100            	all	0.7564
```

We can see that Pyserini's (tuned) BM25 baseline is already much better than the baseline provided by the organizers.

# Pyserini: IRST on MS MARCO V1 Collections

❗ Code associated with these experiments was removed in commit [`a65b96`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/a65b9687a91d1ba0f754445ab0e93dd7116c619f).
This page is preserved only for archival purposes.

This guide describes how to reproduce the IRST (Information Retrieval as Statistical Translation) experiments on the MS MARCO V1 collections, as described in the following paper:

> Yuqi Liu, Chengcheng Hu, and Jimmy Lin. [Another Look at Information Retrieval as Statistical Translation.](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Liu_etal_SIGIR2022.pdf) _Proceedings of the 45th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2022)_, July 2022.

Below, we discuss passage ranking and two document ranking conditions (full docs and segmented docs).

## Passage Ranking

Here, we start directly from our pre-built indexes and already-trained IRST models.
The IBM model we use is referenced in [Boytsov et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06815).
For training the model from scratch, consult the [guide in FlexNeuART](https://github.com/oaqa/FlexNeuART/tree/master/demo).

The following commands will reproduce the results in Table 1 of our paper:

**IRST (Sum)**

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.irst \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage \
  --output runs/run.irst-sum.passage.dev.txt \
  --alpha 0.1
```

**IRST (Max)**

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.irst \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage \
  --output runs/run.irst-max.passage.dev.txt \
  --alpha 0.3 \
  --max-sim
```

The option `--topics` specifies the different topics.
The choices are:

+ MS MARCO V1 passage dev queries: `msmarco-passage-dev-subset` (per above)
+ TREC DL 2019 passage: `dl19-passage`
+ TREC DL 2020 passage: `dl20`

To evaluate results, use `trec_eval`.
For MS MARCO V1 passage:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 10 -m ndcg_cut.10 -m map -m recip_rank \
  msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.irst-sum.passage.dev.txt
```

For TREC DL 2019, note that we need to specify `-l 2`:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m map -m ndcg_cut.10 -l 2 \
  dl19-passage runs/run.irst-sum.passage.dl19.txt
```

Similarly, for TREC DL 2020:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m map -m ndcg_cut.10 -l 2 \
  dl20-passage runs/run.irst-sum.passage.dl20.txt
```

The results should match Table 1 from our paper, repeated below:

|                              | MS MARCO Dev | TREC 2019 |       | TREC 2020 |       |
|:-----------------------------|-------------:|----------:|------:|----------:|------:|
|                              |       MRR@10 |   nDCG@10 |   MAP |   nDCG@10 |   MAP |
| (1a) BM25 (k1= 0.82, b=0.68) |        0.188 |     0.497 | 0.290 |     0.488 | 0.288 |
| (2a) BM25 + IRST (Sum)       |        0.221 |     0.526 | 0.328 |     0.558 | 0.352 |
| (2b) BM25 + IRST (Max)       |        0.215 |     0.537 | 0.329 |     0.547 | 0.336 |

The BM25 baseline is provided for reference.

## Document Ranking

In the paper, we explore two different conditions for document ranking: full documents and segmented documents.

For full documents:

**IRST (Sum)**

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.irst \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --index msmarco-v1-doc \
  --output runs/run.irst-sum.doc-full.dev.txt \
  --alpha 0.3 \
  --hits 1000
```

**IRST (Max)**

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.irst \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --index msmarco-v1-doc \
  --output runs/run.irst-max.doc-full.dev.txt \
  --alpha 0.3 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --max-sim
```

For segmented documents:

**IRST (Sum)** 

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.irst \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --index msmarco-v1-doc-segmented \
  --output runs/run.irst-sum.doc-seg.dev.txt \
  --alpha 0.3 \
  --segments \
  --hits 10000
```

**IRST (Max)**

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene.irst \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --index msmarco-v1-doc-segmented \
  --output runs/run.irst-max.doc-seg.dev.txt \
  --alpha 0.3 \
  --hits 10000 \
  --segments \
  --max-sim
```

The option `--topics` specifies the different topics.
The choices are:

+ MS MARCO V1 doc dev queries: `msmarco-doc-dev` (per above)
+ TREC DL 2019 passage: `dl19-doc`
+ TREC DL 2020 passage: `dl20`

To evaluate results, use `trec_eval`.
For MS MARCO V1 doc:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m ndcg_cut.10 -m map -m recip_rank \
  msmarco-doc-dev runs/run.irst-sum.doc-full.dev.txt
```

For TREC DL 2019:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m ndcg_cut.10 \
  dl19-doc runs/run.irst-sum.doc-full.dl19.txt
```

Similarly, for TREC DL 2020:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m ndcg_cut.10 \
  dl20-doc runs/run.irst-sum.doc-full.dl20.txt
```

The results should match Table 2 from our paper, repeated below:

|                              | MS MARCO Dev | TREC 2019 |       | TREC 2020 |       |
|:-----------------------------|-------------:|----------:|------:|----------:|------:|
|                              |      MRR@100 |   nDCG@10 |   MAP |   nDCG@10 |   MAP |
| **Document (Full)**          |              |           |       |           |       |
| (2a) BM25 (k1= 0.82, b=0.68) |        0.249 |     0.510 | 0.241 |     0.528 | 0.378 |
| (2b) BM25 + IRST (Sum)       |        0.302 |     0.549 | 0.252 |     0.556 | 0.383 |
| (2c) BM25 + IRST (Max)       |        0.252 |     0.491 | 0.220 |     0.502 | 0.337 |
| **Document (Segmented)**     |              |           |       |           |       |
| (3a) BM25 (k1= 0.82, b=0.68) |        0.269 |     0.529 | 0.240 |     0.531 | 0.362 |
| (3b) BM25 + IRST (Sum)       |        0.296 |     0.560 | 0.271 |     0.534 | 0.376 |
| (3c) BM25 + IRST (Max)       |        0.259 |     0.520 | 0.243 |     0.509 | 0.350 |

The BM25 baselines are provided for reference.

For the segmented documents collection, the above commands specify `--hits 10000`, which was the setting used in the SIGIR paper.
Obviously, reducing the number of hits considered, e.g., `--hits 1000`, will speed up running times dramatically, but at the cost of a tiny degradation in effectiveness (in some cases).
Many of the differences aren't even noticeable to three digits, so for reference, to contrast these two settings, we report scores to four digits:

|                                   | MS MARCO Dev | TREC 2019 |        | TREC 2020 |        |
|:----------------------------------|-------------:|----------:|-------:|----------:|-------:|

| **Document (Segmented)**          |              |           |        |           |        |
| BM25 + IRST (Sum): `--hits 10000` |       0.2961 |    0.5596 | 0.2711 |    0.5343 | 0.3759 |
| BM25 + IRST (Max): `--hits 10000` |       0.2589 |    0.5195 | 0.2425 |    0.5089 | 0.3496 |
| BM25 + IRST (Sum): `--hits 1000`  |       0.2936 |    0.5549 | 0.2705 |    0.5343 | 0.3753 |
| BM25 + IRST (Max): `--hits 1000`  |       0.2587 |    0.5187 | 0.2432 |    0.5064 | 0.3482 |


## Reproduction Log[*](reproducibility.md)

# Pyserini: BM25 Baseline for MS MARCO Passage Ranking

This guide contains instructions for running a BM25 baseline on the [MS MARCO *passage* ranking task](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/), which is nearly identical to a [similar guide in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md), except that everything is in Python here (no Java).
Note that there is a separate guide for the [MS MARCO *document* ranking task](experiments-msmarco-doc.md).
This exercise will require a machine with >8 GB RAM and >15 GB free disk space.

If you're a Waterloo student traversing the [onboarding path](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ura.md) (which [starts here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md)),
make sure you've already done the [BM25 Baselines for MS MARCO Passage Ranking **in Anserini**](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md).
In general, don't try to rush through this guide by just blindly copying and pasting commands into a shell;
that's what I call [cargo culting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).
Instead, really try to understand what's going on.

**Learning outcomes** for this guide, building on previous steps in the onboarding path:

+ Be able to use Pyserini to build a Lucene inverted index on the MS MARCO passage collection.
+ Be able to use Pyserini to perform a batch retrieval run on the MS MARCO passage collection with the dev queries.
+ Be able to evaluate the retrieved results above.
+ Be able to generate the retrieved results above _interactively_ by directly manipulating Pyserini Python classes.

In short, you'll do everything you did with Anserini (in Java) on the MS MARCO passage ranking test collection, but now with Pyserini (in Python).

What's Pyserini?
Well, it's the repo that you're in right now.
Pyserini is a Python toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research with sparse and dense representations.
The toolkit provides Python bindings for our group's [Anserini IR toolkit](http://anserini.io/), which is built on Lucene (in Java).
Pyserini provides entrée into the broader deep learning ecosystem, which is heavily Python-centric.

## Data Prep

The guide requires the [development installation](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation).
So get your Python environment set up.

Once you've done that: congratulations, you've passed the most difficult part!
Everything else below mirrors what you did in Anserini (in Java), so it should be easy.

We're going to use `collections/msmarco-passage/` as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO passage dataset:

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-passage

wget https://msmarco.z22.web.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/collectionandqueries.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-passage

# Alternative mirror:
# wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/9f54jg2f71ray3b/collectionandqueries.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-passage

tar xvfz collections/msmarco-passage/collectionandqueries.tar.gz -C collections/msmarco-passage
```

To confirm, `collectionandqueries.tar.gz` should have MD5 checksum of `31644046b18952c1386cd4564ba2ae69`.

Next, we need to convert the MS MARCO tsv collection into Pyserini's jsonl files (which have one json object per line):

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_collection_to_jsonl.py \
 --collection-path collections/msmarco-passage/collection.tsv \
 --output-folder collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl
```

The above script should generate 9 jsonl files in `collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl`, each with 1M lines (except for the last one, which should have 841,823 lines).

## Indexing

We can now index these documents as a `JsonCollection` using Pyserini:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl \
  --index indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-passage \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 9 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw
```

The command-line invocation should look familiar: it essentially mirrors the command with Anserini (in Java).
If you can't make sense of what's going on here, back up and make sure you've first done the [BM25 Baselines for MS MARCO Passage Ranking **in Anserini**](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

Upon completion, you should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD, indexing takes a couple of minutes.

## Retrieval

The 6980 queries in the development set are already stored in the repo.
Let's take a peek:

```bash
$ head tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.txt
1048585	what is paula deen's brother
2	 Androgen receptor define
524332	treating tension headaches without medication
1048642	what is paranoid sc
524447	treatment of varicose veins in legs
786674	what is prime rate in canada
1048876	who plays young dr mallard on ncis
1048917	what is operating system misconfiguration
786786	what is priority pass
524699	tricare service number

$ wc tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.txt
    6980   48335  290193 tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.txt
```

Each line contains a tab-delimited (query id, query) pair.
Conveniently, Pyserini already knows how to load and iterate through these pairs.
We can now perform retrieval using these queries:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-passage \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.bm25tuned.txt \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --hits 1000 \
  --bm25 --k1 0.82 --b 0.68 \
  --threads 4 --batch-size 16
```

Here, we set the BM25 parameters to `k1=0.82`, `b=0.68` (tuned by grid search).
The option `--output-format msmarco` says to generate output in the MS MARCO output format.
The option `--hits` specifies the number of documents to return per query.
Thus, the output file should have approximately 6980 × 1000 = 6.9M lines.

Once again, if you can't make sense of what's going on here, back up and make sure you've first done the [BM25 Baselines for MS MARCO Passage Ranking **in Anserini**](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

Retrieval speed will vary by hardware:
On a reasonably modern CPU with an SSD, we might get around 13 qps (queries per second), and so the entire run should finish in under ten minutes (using a single thread).
We can perform multi-threaded retrieval by using the `--threads` and `--batch-size` arguments.
For example, setting `--threads 16 --batch-size 64` on a CPU with sufficient cores, the entire run will finish in a couple of minutes.

## Evaluation

After the run finishes, we can evaluate the results using the official MS MARCO evaluation script, which has been incorporated into Pyserini:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval \
   tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.txt \
   runs/run.msmarco-passage.bm25tuned.txt

#####################
MRR @10: 0.18741227770955546
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official [TREC](https://trec.nist.gov/) evaluation tool, `trec_eval`, to compute metrics other than MRR@10.

The tool needs a different run format, so it's easier to just run retrieval again:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-passage \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.bm25tuned.trec \
  --hits 1000 \
  --bm25 --k1 0.82 --b 0.68 \
  --threads 4 --batch-size 16
```

The only difference here is that we've removed `--output-format msmarco`.

Then, convert qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_msmarco_to_trec_qrels.py \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.tsv \
  --output collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.trec
```

Finally, run the `trec_eval` tool, which has been incorporated into Pyserini:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap \
   collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.trec \
   runs/run.msmarco-passage.bm25tuned.trec

map                   	all	0.1957
recall_1000           	all	0.8573
```

If you want to examine the MRR@10 for `qid` 1048585:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -q -c -M 10 -m recip_rank \
    collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.trec \
    runs/run.msmarco-passage.bm25tuned.trec | grep 1048585

recip_rank            	1048585	1.0000
```

Once again, if you can't make sense of what's going on here, back up and make sure you've first done the [BM25 Baselines for MS MARCO Passage Ranking **in Anserini**](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

Otherwise, congratulations!
You've done everything that you did in Anserini (in Java), but now in Pyserini (in Python).

## Interactive Retrieval

There's one final thing we should go over.
Because we're in Python now, we get the benefit of having an interactive shell.
Thus, we can run Pyserini interactively.

Try the following:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher('indexes/lucene-index-msmarco-passage')
searcher.set_bm25(0.82, 0.68)
hits = searcher.search('what is paula deen\'s brother')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.6f}')
```

The `LuceneSearcher` class provides search capabilities for BM25.
In the code snippet above, we're issuing the query about Paula Deen's brother (from above).
Note that we're explicitly setting the BM25 parameters, which are not the default parameters.
We get back a list of results (`hits`), which we then iterate through and print out:

```
 1 7187158 18.811600
 2 7187157 18.333401
 3 7187163 17.878799
 4 7546327 16.962099
 5 7187160 16.564699
 6 8227279 16.432501
 7 7617404 16.239901
 8 7187156 16.024900
 9 2298838 15.701500
10 7187155 15.513300
```

You can confirm that the output is the same as `pyserini.search.lucene` from above.

```bash
$ grep 1048585 runs/run.msmarco-passage.bm25tuned.trec | head -10
1048585 Q0 7187158 1 18.811600 Anserini
1048585 Q0 7187157 2 18.333401 Anserini
1048585 Q0 7187163 3 17.878799 Anserini
1048585 Q0 7546327 4 16.962099 Anserini
1048585 Q0 7187160 5 16.564699 Anserini
1048585 Q0 8227279 6 16.432501 Anserini
1048585 Q0 7617404 7 16.239901 Anserini
1048585 Q0 7187156 8 16.024900 Anserini
1048585 Q0 2298838 9 15.701500 Anserini
1048585 Q0 7187155 10 15.513300 Anserini
```

To pull up the actual contents of a hit:

```python
hits[0].lucene_document.get('raw')
```

And you should get:

```
'{\n  "id" : "7187158",\n  "contents" : "Paula Deen and her brother Earl W. Bubba Hiers are being sued by a former general manager at Uncle Bubba\'sâ\x80¦ Paula Deen and her brother Earl W. Bubba Hiers are being sued by a former general manager at Uncle Bubba\'sâ\x80¦"\n}'
```

Everything make sense?
If so, now you're truly done with this guide and are ready to move on and [learn about the relationship between sparse and dense retrieval](conceptual-framework.md)!

Before you move on, however, add an entry in the "Reproduction Log" at the bottom of this page, following the same format: use `yyyy-mm-dd`, make sure you're using a commit id that's on the main trunk of Pyserini, and use its 7-hexadecimal prefix for the link anchor text.

# Pyserini: uniCOIL + TCT-ColBERTv2 for MS MARCO V2

This document also describes hybrid combinations of uniCOIL with our TCT-ColBERTv2 dense retrieval mode.
At present, these indexes are referenced as absolute paths on our Waterloo machine `orca`, so these results are not broadly reproducible.
We are working on figuring out ways to distribute the indexes.

Because there are duplicate passages in MS MARCO V2 collections, score differences might be observed due to tie-breaking effects.
For example, if we output in MS MARCO format `--output-format msmarco` and then convert to TREC format with `pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run`, the scores will be different.

## Passage Ranking

# Pyserini: TCT-ColBERTv2 for MS MARCO (V2) Collections

This guide provides instructions to reproduce experiments using TCT-ColBERTv2 dense retrieval models on the MS MARCO (V2) collections.
The model is described in the following paper:

> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Jheng-Hong Yang, and Jimmy Lin. [In-Batch Negatives for Knowledge Distillation with Tightly-CoupledTeachers for Dense Retrieval.](https://aclanthology.org/2021.repl4nlp-1.17/) _Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP (RepL4NLP-2021)_, pages 163-173, August 2021.

At present, all indexes are referenced as absolute paths on our Waterloo machine `orca`, so these results are not broadly reproducible.
We are working on figuring out ways to distribute the indexes.

For the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, we tried two different approaches:

1. We applied our TCT-ColBERTv2 model trained on MS MARCO (V1) in a zero-shot manner.
2. We started with the above TCT-ColBERTv2 model and further fine-tuned on the MS MARCO (V2) passage data.

In both cases, we applied inference over the MS MARCO V2 [passage corpus](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-v2.md#passage-collection) and [segmented document corpus](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-v2.md#document-collection-segmented) to obtain the dense vectors.

These are the indexes and the encoder for the zero-shot (V1) models:

```bash
export PASSAGE_INDEX0="/store/scratch/indexes/trec2021/faiss-flat.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented"
export DOC_INDEX0="/store/scratch/indexes/trec2021/faiss-flat.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.msmarco-v2-doc-segmented"
export ENCODER0="castorini/tct_colbert-v2-hnp-msmarco"
```

These are the indexes and the encoder for the fine-tuned (V2) models:

```bash
export PASSAGE_INDEX1="/store/scratch/indexes/trec2021/faiss-flat.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.psg_v2_ft.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented"
export DOC_INDEX1="/store/scratch/indexes/trec2021/faiss-flat.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.psg_v2_ft.msmarco-v2-doc-segmented"
export ENCODER1="castorini/tct_colbert-v2-hnp-msmarco-r2"
```

## Passage V2 (Zero Shot)

Dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERTv2 model trained on MS MARCO (V1), with FAISS brute-force index (i.e., zero shot):

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
                             --index ${PASSAGE_INDEX0} \
                             --encoder ${ENCODER0} \
                             --batch-size 144 \
                             --threads 36 \
                             --output runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.dev1.trec \
                             --output-format trec
```

To evaluate using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank collections/passv2_dev_qrels.tsv runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.dev1.trec
Results:
map                   	all	0.1461
recip_rank            	all	0.1473

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 collections/passv2_dev_qrels.tsv runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.dev1.trec
Results:
recall_100            	all	0.5873
recall_1000           	all	0.8321
```

We evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

Because there are duplicate passages in MS MARCO V2 collections, score differences might be observed due to tie-breaking effects.
For example, if we output in MS MARCO format `--output-format msmarco` and then convert to TREC format with `pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run`, the scores will be different.

## Passage V2 (Fine Tuned)

Dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERTv2 model fine-tuned on MS MARCO (V2) passage data, with FAISS brute-force index:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
                             --index ${PASSAGE_INDEX1} \
                             --encoder ${ENCODER1} \
                             --batch-size 144 \
                             --threads 36 \
                             --output runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.psg_v2_ft.dev1.trec \
                             --output-format trec
```

To evaluate using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank collections/passv2_dev_qrels.tsv runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.psg_v2_ft.dev1.trec
Results:
map                   	all	0.1981
recip_rank            	all	0.2000

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 collections/passv2_dev_qrels.tsv runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-augmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.psg_v2_ft.dev1.trec
Results:
recall_100            	all	0.6403
recall_1000           	all	0.8452
```

## Document V2 (Zero Shot)

Dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERT-V2, brute-force index:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics msmarco-v2-doc-dev \
                             --index ${DOC_INDEX0} \
                             --encoder ${ENCODER0} \
                             --batch-size 144 \
                             --threads 36 \
                             --hits 10000 \
                             --max-passage-hits 1000 \
                             --max-passage \
                             --output runs/run.msmarco-document-v2-segmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.dev1.trec \
                             --output-format trec
```

To evaluate using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank collections/docv2_dev_qrels.tsv runs/run.msmarco-document-v2-segmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.dev1.trec
Results:
map                   	all	0.2440
recip_rank            	all	0.2464

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 collections/docv2_dev_qrels.tsv runs/run.msmarco-document-v2-segmented.tct_colbert-v2-hnp.0shot.dev1.trec
Results:
recall_100            	all	0.7873
recall_1000           	all	0.9161
```

We evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

Same comment about duplicate passages and score ties applies here as well.

## Document V2 (Fine Tuned)

# Pyserini: uniCOIL (w/ TILDE) for MS MARCO (V2) Passage Ranking

This page describes how to reproduce experiments using uniCOIL with TILDE document expansion on the MS MARCO V2 passage corpus, as described in the following paper:

> Shengyao Zhuang and Guido Zuccon. [Fast Passage Re-ranking with Contextualized Exact Term
Matching and Efficient Passage Expansion.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08513) _arXiv:2108.08513_.

The original uniCOIL model is described here:

> Jimmy Lin and Xueguang Ma. [A Few Brief Notes on DeepImpact, COIL, and a Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2106.14807_.

In the original uniCOIL paper, doc2query-T5 is used to perform document expansion, which is slow and expensive.
As an alternative, Zhuang and Zuccon proposed to use the TILDE model to expand the documents instead, resulting in a faster and cheaper process that is just as effective.
For details of how to use TILDE to expand documents, please refer to the [TIDLE repo](https://github.com/ielab/TILDE).
For additional details on the original uniCOIL design (with doc2query-T5 expansion), please refer to the [COIL repo](https://github.com/luyug/COIL/tree/main/uniCOIL).

In this guide, we start with a version of the MS MARCO V2 passage corpus that has already been processed with uniCOIL + TILDE, i.e., gone through document expansion and term re-weighting.
Thus, no neural inference is involved.

## Data Prep

> You can skip the data prep and indexing steps if you use our pre-built indexes. Skip directly down to the "Retrieval" section below.

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO V2 passage dataset with uniCOIL + TILDE processing:

```bash
# Alternate mirrors of the same data, pick one:
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco-passage-v2-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar -P collections/
wget https://vault.cs.uwaterloo.ca/s/tb3m3J45HFJNAbq/download -O collections/msmarco-passage-v2-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar

tar -xvf collections/msmarco-passage-v2-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-passage-v2-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar` is around 58 GB and should have an MD5 checksum of `acc4c9bc3506c3a496bf3e009fa6e50b`.

## Indexing

We can now index these docs:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage-v2-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8/ \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

The important indexing options to note here are `--impact --pretokenized`: the first tells Pyserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the uniCOIL tokens.

Upon completion, we should have an index with 138,364,198 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD (using 12 threads, per above), indexing takes around 5 hours.

<!-- This is deprecated because we have pre-built indexes. Retaining for historic reasons.

If you want to save time and skip the indexing step, download the prebuilt index directly:

```bash
# Alternate mirrors of the same data, pick one:
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar.gz -P indexes/
wget https://vault.cs.uwaterloo.ca/s/rmFJCYEqfPrxcFE/download -O indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar.gz

tar -xzvf indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar.gz -C indexes/
```

To confirm, `lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar.gz` is around 30 GB and should have an MD5 checksum of `0f9b1f90751d49dd3a66be54dd0b4f82`.
This pre-built index was created with the above command, but with the addition of the `-optimize` option to merge index segments.

-->

## Retrieval

> If you've skipped the data prep and indexing steps and wish to directly use our pre-built indexes, use `--index msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde` in the command below.

We can now run retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion \
  --topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
  --encoder ielab/unicoil-tilde200-msmarco-passage \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil-tilde-expansion.txt \
  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we are using the transformer model to encode the queries on the fly using the CPU.
Note that the important option here is `--impact`, where we specify impact scoring.
With these impact scores, query evaluation is already slower than bag-of-words BM25; on top of that we're adding neural inference on the CPU.
A complete run should take around 30 minutes.

To evaluate, using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank msmarco-v2-passage-dev runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil-tilde-expansion.txt
Results:
map                   	all	0.1476
recip_rank            	all	0.1486

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 msmarco-v2-passage-dev runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil-tilde-expansion.txt
Results:
recall_100            	all	0.5630
recall_1000           	all	0.7733
```

There might be small differences in score due to platform differences in neural inference.
The above score was obtained on Linux; macOS results may be slightly different.

Alternatively, we can use pre-tokenized queries with pre-computed weights.
First, fetch the queries:

```bash
# Alternate mirrors of the same data, pick one:
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/topics.msmarco-v2-passage.dev.unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv.gz -P collections/
wget https://vault.cs.uwaterloo.ca/s/AAgRffaWQXdo8zi/download -O collections/topics.msmarco-v2-passage.dev.unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv.gz
```

The MD5 checksum of the topics file should be `9c4fe0513cc8f45b44809f65c3c8bc20`.

We can now run retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion \
  --topics collections/topics.msmarco-v2-passage.dev.unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv.gz \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil-tilde-expansion.txt \
  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we also specify `--impact` for impact scoring.
Since we're not applying neural inference over the queries, retrieval is faster, typically less than 10 minutes.
To evaluate using `trec_eval`, follow the same instructions above.
These results may be slightly different from the figures above, but they should be the same across platforms.

# Pyserini: uniCOIL w/ doc2query-T5 on MS MARCO V2

This guide describes how to reproduce retrieval experiments with the uniCOIL model on the MS MARCO V2 collections.
Details about our model can be found in the following paper:

> Jimmy Lin and Xueguang Ma. [A Few Brief Notes on DeepImpact, COIL, and a Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2106.14807_.

And further detailed in:

[Document Expansions and Learned Sparse Lexical Representations for MS MARCO V1 and V2.](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Ma_etal_SIGIR2022.pdf) _Proceedings of the 45th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2022)_, July 2022.

Here, we start with versions of the MS MARCO V2 corpora that have already been processed with uniCOIL, i.e., we have applied model inference on every document and stored the output sparse vectors.

## Passage Ranking (No Expansion)

For the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, we did not have time to train a new uniCOIL model on V2 data and we did not have time to finish doc2query-T5 expansions.
Thus, we applied uniCOIL without expansions in a zero-shot manner using the model trained on the MS MARCO V1 passage corpus.

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V2 passage](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v2-passage.html).
The passage ranking experiments here correspond to row (3a) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference.

To build the indexes from scratch, download the sparse representation of the corpus generated by uniCOIL:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot.tar -P collections/
tar -xvf collections/msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot.tar` is 24 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `d9cc1ed3049746e68a2c91bf90e5212d`.

To index the sparse vectors:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_noexp_0shot/ \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 32 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

To perform retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot/ \
  --topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
  --encoder castorini/unicoil-noexp-msmarco-passage \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt \
  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

To evaluate, using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
map                   	all	0.1334
recip_rank            	all	0.1343

$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.100,1000 msmarco-v2-passage-dev \
    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
recall_100            	all	0.4983
recall_1000           	all	0.7010
```

Note that we evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-noexp-0shot.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil-noexp`.

## Passage Ranking (With doc2query-T5 Expansion)

After the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track submissions, we were able to complete doc2query-T5 expansions.

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V2 passage](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v2-passage.html).
The passage ranking experiments here correspond to row (3b) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference.

```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_passage_unicoil_0shot.tar` is 41 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `1949a00bfd5e1f1a230a04bbc1f01539`.

To index the sparse vectors:

    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
map                     all     0.1488
recip_rank              all     0.1501

    runs/run.msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-0shot.dev.txt

Results:
recall_100              all     0.5515
recall_1000             all     0.7613
```

Note that we evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-passage-unicoil-0shot.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-passage-dev-unicoil`.

## Document Ranking (No Expansion)

For the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, we did not have time to train a new uniCOIL model on V2 data and we did not have time to finish doc2query-T5 expansions.
Thus, we applied uniCOIL without expansions in a zero-shot manner using the model trained on the MS MARCO V1 passage corpus.
When performing inference on the documents using the uniCOIL model here, we prepended the document title to provide context.
This is more effective than not prepending the title, which is also a condition that we have tried.

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V2 doc](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v2-doc.html).
The document ranking experiments here correspond to row (3a) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference.

```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_noexp_0shot_v2.tar` is 55 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `97ba262c497164de1054f357caea0c63`.

  --batch 144 --threads 36 \
  --hits 10000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

For the document corpus, since we are searching the segmented version, we retrieve the top 10k _segments_ and perform MaxP to obtain the top 1000 _documents_.

To evaluate, using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m map -m recip_rank msmarco-v2-doc-dev \

Results:
recall_100            	all	0.7460
recall_1000           	all	0.8987
```

We evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-doc-segmented-unicoil-noexp-0shot.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-doc-dev-unicoil-noexp`.

recall_1000             all     0.9120
```

We evaluate MAP and MRR at a cutoff of 100 hits to match the official evaluation metrics.
However, we measure recall at both 100 and 1000 hits; the latter is a common setting for reranking.

These results differ slightly from [the regressions in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-v2-doc-segmented-unicoil-0shot-v2.md) because here we are performing on-the-fly query encoding, whereas the Anserini indexes use pre-encoded queries.
To reproduce the Anserini results, use pre-encoded queries with `--topics msmarco-v2-doc-dev-unicoil`.

# Pyserini: Reproducing Arctic Results

## MS marco v2.1 doc
In order to handle msmarco v2.1 dataset's large size, we have the indexes divided in two partitions. Thus we need to perform retrieval runs for both of the indexes.

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss --index msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented-shard01.arctic-embed-l \
--topics msmarco-v2-doc.dev \ 
--encoder Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l \
--output run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.arctic-embed-l-1.dev.txt \
--hits 2000 --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --max-passage-hits 1000 --max-passage


python -m pyserini.search.faiss --index msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented-shard02.arctic-embed-l \
--topics msmarco-v2-doc.dev \ 
--encoder Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l \
--output run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.arctic-embed-l-2.dev.txt \
--hits 2000 --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --max-passage-hits 1000 --max-passage
```

### Merging and compiling docwise results
As the available embeddings refer to doc segments, we need to complile doc wise results. Thus we merge and compile them with:
```bash
python scripts/arctic/merge_retrieved_results.py --arctic_run_folder arctic_runs \
--output_file run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.arctic-embed-l-merged.dev.txt \
--k 1000
```

### Evaluation
```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m recall.1000 -m recall.100 -m ndcg_cut.10 msmarco-v2.1-doc.dev run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.arctic-embed-l-merged.dev.txt
Results:
recall_1000           	all	0.9408
recall_100            	all	0.8513
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.3583
```

# Pyserini: BM25 Baselines for MS MARCO V2.1

The MS MARCO V2.1 document corpus was curated for the [TREC 2024 RAG Track](https://trec-rag.github.io/) and comes in two flavors: the doc corpus and the segmented doc corpus.
We have implemented BM25 baselines.
This guide provides instructions for getting started with both variants using Pyserini: we provide prebuilt indexes that you can use "right out of the box".

This guide describes features introduced in Pyserini v0.37.0 (built on Anserini v0.37.0).

❗ Beware, you need lots of space to run these experiments.
The `msmarco-v2.1-doc` prebuilt index is 63 GB uncompressed.
The `msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented` prebuilt index is 84 GB uncompressed.
Both indexes will be downloaded automatically with the following commands.

## Batch Runs on TREC 2024 RAG Topics

Bindings for the test topics for the [TREC 2024 RAG Track](https://trec-rag.github.io/) (`--topics rag24.test`) are provided.
For example:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --threads 16 --batch-size 128 \
  --index msmarco-v2.1-doc \
  --topics rag24.test \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.bm25.rag24.test.txt \
  --bm25 --hits 100
```

Replace `--index msmarco-v2.1-doc` with `--index msmarco-v2.1-doc-segemented` if you want to search over the doc segments instead of the full docs.

You can peek inside a retrieved results:

```bash
% head runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.bm25.rag24.test.txt
2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_38_1524878562 1 14.487700 Anserini
2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_19_1675146822 2 14.383500 Anserini

2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_07_1482029316 5 13.604300 Anserini
2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_53_730598621 6 13.336300 Anserini
2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_16_226489424 7 13.249400 Anserini
2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_46_703092678 8 12.968000 Anserini
2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_58_272550136 9 12.667500 Anserini
2024-105741 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_46_702606697 10 12.555100 Anserini
```

And use existing Pyserini features to access the actual text of the documents, for example:

```python
import json

from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-v2.1-doc')
doc = searcher.doc('msmarco_v2.1_doc_38_1524878562')

# Raw document (JSON)
doc.raw()

# Pretty-print JSON
print(json.dumps(json.loads(doc.raw()), indent=2))
```

## REST API and Webapp

Pyserini provides a REST API for programmatic access (in truth, it's just a wrapper around a Java application in Anserini):

```bash
python -m pyserini.server.AnseriniApplication --server.port=8082
```

Here's a specific example of using the REST API to issue the query "How does the process of digestion and metabolism of carbohydrates start" to `msmarco-v2.1-doc`:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8082/api/v1.0/indexes/msmarco-v2.1-doc/search?query=How%20does%20the%20process%20of%20digestion%20and%20metabolism%20of%20carbohydrates%20start"
```

And the output looks something like (pipe through `jq` to pretty-print):

```bash
{
  "query": {
    "text": "How does the process of digestion and metabolism of carbohydrates start",
    "qid": ""
  },
  "candidates": [
    {
      "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_15_390497775",
      "score": 14.3364,
      "doc": {
        "url": "https://diabetestalk.net/blood-sugar/conversion-of-carbohydrates-to-glucose",
        "title": "Conversion Of Carbohydrates To Glucose | DiabetesTalk.Net",
        "headings": "...",
        "body": "..."
      }
    },
    {
      "docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_15_416962410",
      "score": 14.2271,
      "doc": {
        "url": "https://diabetestalk.net/insulin/how-is-starch-converted-to-glucose-in-the-body",
        "title": "How Is Starch Converted To Glucose In The Body? | DiabetesTalk.Net",
        "headings": "...",
        "body": "..."
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Switch to `msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented` in the route to query the segmented docs instead.
Adjust the `hits` parameter to change the number of hits returned.

The API also provides an interactive search interface.
To access it, navigate to [`http://localhost:8082/`](http://localhost:8082/) in your browser.

## Batch Runs on Existing Topics

Since the TREC 2024 RAG evaluation hasn't concluded yet, there are no qrels for evaluation.
However, we _do_ have results based existing qrels that have been "projected" over from MS MARCO V2.0 passage judgments.
The table below reports effectiveness (dev in terms of RR@10, DL21-DL23, RAGgy in terms of nDCG@10):

|                                                                            |    dev |   dev2 |   DL21 |   DL22 |   DL23 |  RAGgy |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| BM25 doc (<i>k<sub><small>1</small></sub></i>=0.9, <i>b</i>=0.4)           | 0.1654 | 0.1732 | 0.5183 | 0.2991 | 0.2914 | 0.3631 |
| BM25 doc-segmented (<i>k<sub><small>1</small></sub></i>=0.9, <i>b</i>=0.4) | 0.1973 | 0.2000 | 0.5778 | 0.3576 | 0.3356 | 0.4227 |

The following commands show how to run Pyserini on the "RAGgy" queries and evaluate effectiveness, on both the doc corpus and the segmented doc corpus (rightmost column):

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --index msmarco-v2.1-doc --topics rag24.raggy-dev --output runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.dev.txt --bm25
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m ndcg_cut.10 rag24.raggy-dev runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc.dev.txt

python -m pyserini.search.lucene --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --index msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented --topics rag24.raggy-dev --output runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.dev.txt --bm25 --hits 10000 --max-passage-hits 1000 --max-passage
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -M 100 -m ndcg_cut.10 rag24.raggy-dev runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.dev.txt
```

The following snippet will generate the complete set of results that corresponds to the above table:

```bash
export OUTPUT_DIR="runs"

# doc condition
TOPICS=(msmarco-v2-doc.dev msmarco-v2-doc.dev2 dl21-doc dl22-doc dl23-doc rag24.raggy-dev); for t in "${TOPICS[@]}"
do
    python -m pyserini.search.lucene --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --index msmarco-v2.1-doc --topics $t --output $OUTPUT_DIR/run.msmarco-v2.1.doc.${t}.txt --bm25
done

# doc-segmented condition
TOPICS=(msmarco-v2-doc.dev msmarco-v2-doc.dev2 dl21-doc dl22-doc dl23-doc rag24.raggy-dev); for t in "${TOPICS[@]}"
do
    python -m pyserini.search.lucene --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --index msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented --topics $t --output $OUTPUT_DIR/run.msmarco-v2.1.doc-segmented.${t}.txt --bm25 --hits 10000 --max-passage-hits 1000 --max-passage

```

# Pyserini: BM25 Baselines for the MS MARCO V2 Collections

This guide contains instructions for running baselines on the MS MARCO V2 passage and document test collections,
which mirrors a [similar guide in Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-v2.md) except that everything is in Python here (no Java).
To reduce duplication of content, this guide will refer to the Anserini for shared instructions and descriptions.

## Data Prep

These instructions are exactly the same as in the [Anserini guide](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-v2.md).

## Passage Collection

This is the minimal indexing command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection MsMarcoV2PassageCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco_v2_passage \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-v2-passage \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12
```

# NFCorpus Atlas Visualization

We can locally create an interactive visualization of NFCorpus using Apple's Embedding Atlas Library. 
This guide will allow us to see how the 3,633 medical documents cluster in 2D space based on their BGE embeddings.

**Important**: Make sure to complete the [BGE-base Baseline for NFCorpus](experiments-nfcorpus.md) first to download the NFCorpus dataset and generate BGE embeddings.

## Install Dependencies

To get started, we need to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install uv datasets pandas
```

## Data Prep

Now let's do some data munging to turn our NFCorpus data to a HuggingFace dataset format:

```python
from datasets import Dataset
import json
import pandas as pd

docs = []
with open('collections/nfcorpus/corpus.jsonl', 'r') as reader:
    for line in reader:
        doc = json.loads(line)
        docs.append({
            'id': doc['_id'],
            'title': doc['title'],
            'text': doc['text'],
            'url': doc['metadata']['url'],
            'full_text': f"{doc['title']} {doc['text']}"
        })

print(f"Loaded {len(docs)} documents")

df = pd.DataFrame(docs)
dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)
dataset.to_parquet('nfcorpus.parquet')
```

If you're curious about the HuggingFace Datasets library we are using, see their [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/)

## Atlas Generation

We can generate the atlas visualization:

```bash
uv run https://huggingface.co/datasets/uv-scripts/build-atlas/raw/main/atlas-export.py \
    nfcorpus.parquet \
    --space-name nfcorpus-atlas \
    --text-column full_text \
    --model BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 \
    --local-only \
    --output-dir ./nfcorpus-atlas
```

The `--local-only` flag creates the visualization files locally without deploying to a public HuggingFace Space.

## View the Visualization

To see the visualization in your browser, start a local web server:

```bash
cd nfcorpus-atlas
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` and explore the topics and clusters! 

You can search for specific terms and hover over individual documents to see their content.

Here is an example:

<img src="images/nfcorpus-atlas-vis.png" width="800" />

When opening your pull request, be sure to include a screenshot of your visualization!

# Pyserini: BGE-base Baseline for NFCorpus

This guide contains instructions for running a BGE-base baseline for NFCorpus.

If you're a Waterloo student traversing the [onboarding path](https://github.com/lintool/guide/blob/master/ura.md) (which [starts here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md)),
make sure you've first done the previous step, [a conceptual framework for retrieval](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/conceptual-framework.md).
In general, don't try to rush through this guide by just blindly copying and pasting commands into a shell;
that's what I call [cargo culting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).
Instead, really try to understand what's going on.

If you've traversed the onboarding path, by now you've learned the basics of bag-of-words retrieval with BM25 using Lucene (via Anserini and Pyserini).
Conceptually, you understand how it's a specific manifestation of a bi-encoder architecture where the vector representations are _lexical_ and the weights are assigned in an _unsupervised_ (or _heuristic_) manner.

In this guide, we're going to go through an example of retrieval using a _learned_, _dense_ representation.
These are often called "dense retrieval models" and informally referred to as "vector search".
Coming back to here:

<img src="images/architecture-dense.png" width="400" />

The document and query encoders are now transformer-based models that are trained on large amounts of _supervised_ data.
The outputs of the encoders are often called **embedding vectors**, or just **embeddings** for short.

For this guide, assume that we've already got trained encoders.
How to actually train such models will be covered later.

**Learning outcomes** for this guide, building on previous steps in the onboarding path:

+ Be able to use Pyserini to encode documents in NFCorpus with an existing dense retrieval model (BGE-base) and to build a Faiss index on the vector representations.
+ Be able to use Pyserini to perform a batch retrieval run on queries from NFCorpus.
+ Be able to evaluate the retrieved results above.
+ Be able to generate the retrieved results above _interactively_ by directly manipulating Pyserini Python classes.

## Data Prep

In this lesson, we'll be working with [NFCorpus](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/nfcorpus/), a full-text learning to rank dataset for medical information retrieval.
The rationale is that the corpus is quite small &mdash; only 3633 documents &mdash; so the latency of CPU-based inference with neural models (i.e., the encoders) is tolerable, i.e., this lesson is doable on a laptop.
It is not practical to work with the MS MARCO passage ranking corpus using CPUs.

Let's first start by fetching the data:

```bash
wget https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/thakur/BEIR/datasets/nfcorpus.zip -P collections
unzip collections/nfcorpus.zip -d collections
```

This just gives you an idea of what the corpus contains:

```bash
$ head -1 collections/nfcorpus/corpus.jsonl
{"_id": "MED-10", "title": "Statin Use and Breast Cancer Survival: A Nationwide Cohort Study from Finland", "text": "Recent studies have suggested that statins, an established drug group in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality, could delay or prevent breast cancer recurrence but the effect on disease-specific mortality remains unclear. We evaluated risk of breast cancer death among statin users in a population-based cohort of breast cancer patients. The study cohort included all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in Finland during 1995\u20132003 (31,236 cases), identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Information on statin use before and after the diagnosis was obtained from a national prescription database. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate mortality among statin users with statin use as time-dependent variable. A total of 4,151 participants had used statins. During the median follow-up of 3.25 years after the diagnosis (range 0.08\u20139.0 years) 6,011 participants died, of which 3,619 (60.2%) was due to breast cancer. After adjustment for age, tumor characteristics, and treatment selection, both post-diagnostic and pre-diagnostic statin use were associated with lowered risk of breast cancer death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38\u20130.55 and HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.44\u20130.67, respectively). The risk decrease by post-diagnostic statin use was likely affected by healthy adherer bias; that is, the greater likelihood of dying cancer patients to discontinue statin use as the association was not clearly dose-dependent and observed already at low-dose/short-term use. The dose- and time-dependence of the survival benefit among pre-diagnostic statin users suggests a possible causal effect that should be evaluated further in a clinical trial testing statins\u2019 effect on survival in breast cancer patients.", "metadata": {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329299"}}
```

We need to do a bit of data munging to get the queries into the right format (from json to tsv).
Run the following Python script:

```python
import json

with open('collections/nfcorpus/queries.tsv', 'w') as out:
    with open('collections/nfcorpus/queries.jsonl', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            l = json.loads(line)
            out.write(l['_id'] + '\t' + l['text'] + '\n')
```

Similarly, we need to munge the relevance judgments (qrels) into the right format.
This command-line invocation does the trick:

```bash
tail -n +2 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.tsv | sed 's/\t/\tQ0\t/' > collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels
```

Okay, the data are ready now.

## Indexing

We can now "index" these documents using Pyserini:

```bash
python -m pyserini.encode \
  input   --corpus collections/nfcorpus/corpus.jsonl \
          --fields title text \
  output  --embeddings indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5 \
          --to-faiss \
  encoder --encoder BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 --l2-norm \
          --device cpu \
          --pooling mean \
          --fields title text \
          --batch 32
```

We're using the [`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) encoder, which can be found on HuggingFace.
Use `--device cuda` for a faster computation if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU.

<details>
<summary>Try it using the Contriever model!</summary>
<br/>

```bash
python -m pyserini.encode \
  input   --corpus collections/nfcorpus/corpus.jsonl \
          --fields title text \
  output  --embeddings indexes/faiss.nfcorpus.contriever-msmacro \
          --to-faiss \
  encoder --encoder facebook/contriever-msmarco \
          --device cpu \
          --pooling mean \
          --fields title text \
          --batch 32
```

We're using the [`facebook/contriever-msmarco`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/contriever-msmarco) encoder, which can be found on HuggingFace.
Use `--device cuda` for a faster computation if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU.
</details>
<br/>

Pyserini wraps [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/), which is a library for efficient similarity search on dense vectors.
That is, once all the documents have been encoded (i.e., converted into representation vectors), they are passed to Faiss to manage (i.e., for storage and for search later on).
"Index" here is in quotes because, in reality we're using something called a ["flat" index](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Faiss-indexes) (`FlatIP` to be exact), which just stores the vectors in fixed-width bytes, one after the other.
At search time, each document vector is sequentially compared to the query vector.
In other words, the library just performs brute force dot products of each query vector against all document vectors.

The above indexing command takes around 30 minutes to run on a modern laptop, with most of the time occupied by performing neural inference using the CPU.
Adjust the `batch` parameter above accordingly for your hardware; 32 is the default, but reduce the value if you find that the encoding is taking too long.

## Retrieval

We can now perform retrieval in Pyserini using the following command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --encoder-class auto --encoder BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 --l2-norm \
  --pooling mean \
  --index indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5 \
  --topics collections/nfcorpus/queries.tsv \
  --output runs/run.beir.bge-base-en-v1.5.nfcorpus.txt \
  --batch 128 --threads 8 \
  --hits 1000
```

(Adjust the `batch` and `threads` parameters above accordingly for your hardware; e.g., lower the settings on a laptop.)

The queries are in `collections/nfcorpus/queries.tsv`.

<details>
<summary>If you indexed with Contriever above, try retrieval with it too:</summary>
<br/>

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --encoder-class contriever --encoder facebook/contriever-msmarco \
  --index indexes/faiss.nfcorpus.contriever-msmacro \
  --topics collections/nfcorpus/queries.tsv \
  --output runs/run.beir-contriever-msmarco.nfcorpus.txt \
  --batch 128 --threads 8 \
  --hits 1000
```

(Adjust the `batch` and `threads` parameters above accordingly for your hardware; e.g., lower the settings on a laptop.)

</details>
<br/>

As mentioned above, Pyserini wraps the [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/) library.
With the flat index here, we're performing brute-force computation of dot products (albeit in parallel and with batching).
As a result, we are performing _exact_ search, i.e., we are finding the _exact_ top-_k_ documents that have the highest dot products.

The above retrieval command takes only a few minutes on a modern laptop.
Adjust the `threads` and `batch` parameters above accordingly for your hardware.

## Evaluation

After the run finishes, we can evaluate the results using `trec_eval`:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval \
  -c -m ndcg_cut.10 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels \
  runs/run.beir.bge-base-en-v1.5.nfcorpus.txt
```
The results will be something like:

```
Results:
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.3808
```

<details>
<summary>And if you've been following along with Contriever:</summary>
<br/>

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval \
  -c -m ndcg_cut.10 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels \
  runs/run.beir-contriever-msmarco.nfcorpus.txt
```

The results will be something like:

```
Results:
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.3306
```

</details>
<br/>

If you've gotten here, congratulations!
You've completed your first indexing and retrieval run using a dense retrieval model.

## Interactive Retrieval

The final step, as with Lucene, is to learn to use the dense retriever _interactively_.
This contrasts with the _batch_ run above.

Here's the snippet of Python code that does what we want:

```python
from pyserini.search.faiss import FaissSearcher
from pyserini.encode import AutoQueryEncoder

encoder = AutoQueryEncoder('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5', device='cpu', pooling='mean', l2_norm=True)
searcher = FaissSearcher('indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5', encoder)
hits = searcher.search('How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.6f}')
```

The `FaissSearcher` provides search capabilities using Faiss as its underlying implementation.
The `AutoQueryEncoder` allows us to initialize an encoder using a HuggingFace model.

```

# Pyserini: Reproducing Robust04 Baselines

The `SimpleSearcher` class provides the entry point for searching.
Pyserini provides, out of the box, a pre-built index for TREC Disks 4 &amp; 5, used in the [TREC 2004 Robust Track](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions/regressions-disk45.md):

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')
hits = searcher.search('hubble space telescope')

# Print the first 10 hits:
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:15} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 LA071090-0047   16.85690
 2 FT934-5418      16.75630
 3 FT921-7107      16.68290
 4 LA052890-0021   16.37390
 5 LA070990-0052   16.36460
 6 LA062990-0180   16.19260
 7 LA070890-0154   16.15610
 8 FT934-2516      16.08950
 9 LA041090-0148   16.08810
10 FT944-128       16.01920
```

To further examine the results:

```python
# Grab the raw text:
hits[0].lucene_document.get('raw')
```

Configure BM25 parameters and use RM3 query expansion:

```python
searcher.set_bm25(0.9, 0.4)
searcher.set_rm3(10, 10, 0.5)

hits2 = searcher.search('hubble space telescope')

# Print the first 10 hits:
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits2[i].docid:15} {hits2[i].score:.5f}')
```

If you want to perform a batch retrieval run, it's simple:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.search.lucene --topics robust04 --index robust04 --output run.robust04.txt --bm25
```

And to evaluate using `trec_eval`:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -m map -m P.30 robust04 run.robust04.txt
map                   	all	0.2531
P_30                  	all	0.3102
```

# Pyserini: Reproducing SBERT Results

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the SBERT dense retrieval models for MS MARCO passage ranking (v3) described [here](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/docs/pretrained-models/msmarco-v3.md).

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

Dense retrieval, brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.sbert \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries sbert-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Replace `--encoded-queries` by `--encoder sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-v3` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval \
  msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.tsv
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3314
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
    runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.trec
```

Results:

```
map                     all     0.3373
recall_1000             all     0.9558
```

Hybrid retrieval with dense-sparse representations (without document expansion):
- dense retrieval with SBERT, brute force index.
- sparse retrieval with BM25 `msmarco-passage` (i.e., default bag-of-words) index.

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.hybrid \
  dense  --index msmarco-v1-passage.sbert \
         --encoded-queries sbert-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  sparse --index msmarco-passage \
  fusion --alpha 0.015  \
  run    --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
         --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.bm25.tsv \
         --output-format msmarco \
         --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Replace `--encoded-queries` by `--encoder sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-v3` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval \
  msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.bm25.tsv
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3379
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

And more evaluation:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.bm25.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.bm25.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.sbert.bm25.trec
```

Results:
```
map                     all     0.3445
recall_1000             all     0.9659
```

# --- experiments-slim.md ---

# Pyserini: SLIM on MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This guide describes how to reproduce the SLIM experiments in the following paper:

> Minghan Li, Sheng-Chieh Lin, Xueguang Ma, Jimmy Lin. [SLIM: Sparsified Late Interaction for Multi-Vector Retrieval with
Inverted Indexes.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06587) _arXiv:2302.06587_.

The training code is provided [here](https://github.com/alexlimh/SLIM).

Due to a naming conflict with [the "slim" version of Lucene indexes](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/f010aa17a8f51887c056bff2f52f85d78e6eb27b/pyserini/resources/index-metadata/lucene-index.msmarco-v1-passage-slim.20220131.9ea315.README.md), we use `slimr` to denote our model, which stands for "slim retrieval".

To reproduce the non-distilled version of SLIM, we run retrieval using the `castorini/slimr-msmarco-passage` model available on Huggingface's model hub:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage-slimr \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoder castorini/slimr-msmarco-passage \
  --encoded-corpus scipy-sparse-vectors.msmarco-v1-passage-slimr \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.slimr.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact --min-idf 3
```

Here, we are using the transformer model to encode the queries on the fly using the CPU.
Note that the important option here is `--impact`, where we specify impact scoring.
With these impact scores, query evaluation is already slower than bag-of-words BM25; on top of that we're adding neural inference on the CPU.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.slimr.tsv

#####################
MRR @10: 0.3581149656615276
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

For the distilled version, we could follow the similar procedure of indexing and retrieval:

Retrieval
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage-slimr-pp \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoder castorini/slimr-pp-msmarco-passage \
  --encoded-corpus scipy-sparse-vectors.msmarco-v1-passage-slimr-pp \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.slimr-pp.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact --min-idf 3
```

Evaluation
```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.slimr-pp.tsv

#####################
MRR @10: 0.40315936689862253
QueriesRanked: 6974
#####################
```
The final QueriesRanked is less than 6980, which results from the excessive pruning using min-idf=3, and therefore some queries' representations are completely pruned and therefore they return no ranking list. To avoid this, use smaller min-idf which, however, might increase the search latency.


## Reproduction Log[*](reproducibility.md)



# --- experiments-spladev2.md ---

# Pyserini: SPLADEv2 on MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This page describes how to reproduce with Pyserini the DistilSPLADE-max experiments in the following paper:

> Thibault Formal, Carlos Lassance, Benjamin Piwowarski, Stéphane Clinchant. [SPLADE v2: Sparse Lexical and Expansion Model for Information Retrieval.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10086) _arXiv:2109.10086_.

Here, we start with a version of the MS MARCO passage corpus that has already been processed with SPLADE, i.e., gone through document expansion and term reweighting.
Thus, no neural inference is involved. As SPLADE weights are given in fp16, they have been converted to integer by taking the round of weight*100.

## Data Prep

> You can skip the data prep and indexing steps if you use our pre-built indexes. Skip directly down to the "Retrieval" section below.

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO passage dataset with SPLADE processing:

```bash
# Alternate mirrors of the same data, pick one:
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tar -P collections/
wget https://vault.cs.uwaterloo.ca/s/poCLbJDMm7JxwPk/download -O collections/msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tar

tar xvf collections/msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tar` is 9.9 GB and has MD5 checksum `95b89a7dfd88f3685edcc2d1ffb120d1`.

## Indexing

We can now index these documents:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

The important indexing options to note here are `--impact --pretokenized`: the first tells Anserini not to encode BM25 doc lengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the SPLADEv2 tokens.

Upon completion, we should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD (using 12 threads, per above), indexing takes around 30 minutes.

## Retrieval

> If you've skipped the data prep and indexing steps and wish to directly use our pre-built indexes, use `--index msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max` in the command below.

Before we run retrieval, we need to download the model for encoding the queries.
This checkpoint is not available on Huggingface's model hub, and needs to be fetched from NAVER's [website](https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/machine-learning-and-optimization/splade-models/):

```bash
wget https://download-de.europe.naverlabs.com/Splade_Release_Jan22/distilsplade_max.tar.gz
tar -xvf distilsplade_max.tar.gz
mv distilsplade_max distill-splade-max
```

We can now run retrieval using the local `distill-splade-max` model to encode the queries:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoder distill-splade-max \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we are using the transformer model to encode the queries on the fly using the CPU.
Note that the important option here is `--impact`, where we specify impact scoring.
With these impact scores, query evaluation is already slower than bag-of-words BM25; on top of that we're adding neural inference on the CPU.
A complete run can take around an hour.

*Note from authors*: We are still investigating why it takes so long using Pyserini, while the same model (including distilbert query encoder forward pass in CPU) takes only **10 minutes** on similar hardware using a numba implementation for the inverted index and using sequential processing (only one query at a time).

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tsv
```

The results should be as follows:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3684321417201083
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

The final evaluation metric is the same as the score reported in the paper (0.368).
There might be small differences in score due to non-determinism in neural inference; see [these notes](reproducibility.md) for detail.

Alternatively, we can use pre-tokenized queries with pre-computed weights, which are already included in Pyserini.
We can run retrieval as follows:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset-distill-splade-max \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we also specify `--impact` for impact scoring.
Since we're not applying neural inference over the queries, retrieval is faster.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.tsv
```

The results should be as follows:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.36852691363078205
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

Note that in this case, the results should be deterministic.

# Pyserini: Reproducing TCT-ColBERTv2 for MS MARCO V1

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the family of TCT-ColBERT-V2 dense retrieval models described in the following paper:

> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Jheng-Hong Yang, and Jimmy Lin. [In-Batch Negatives for Knowledge Distillation with Tightly-CoupledTeachers for Dense Retrieval.](https://aclanthology.org/2021.repl4nlp-1.17/) _Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP (RepL4NLP-2021)_, pages 163-173, August 2021.

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

The slight differences between the reproduced scores and those reported in the paper can be attributed to TensorFlow implementations in the published paper vs. PyTorch implementations here in this reproduction guide.

### TCT_ColBERT-V2

Dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERT (v2), brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.tct_colbert-v2 \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries tct_colbert-v2-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Note that to ensure maximum reproducibility, by default Pyserini uses pre-computed query representations that are automatically downloaded.
As an alternative, replace with `--encoder castorini/tct_colbert-v2-msmarco` to perform "on-the-fly" query encoding, i.e., convert text queries into dense vectors as part of the dense retrieval process.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2.tsv
```

Results:

```

```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2.trec
```

Results:

```
map                     all     0.3509
recall_1000             all     0.9670
```

### TCT_ColBERT-V2-HN

Dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERT (v2) HN variant, brute-force index:

  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries tct_colbert-v2-hn-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2-hn.tsv \

# Pyserini: Reproducing TCT-ColBERT for MS MARCO V1

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the TCT-ColBERT dense retrieval model described in the following paper:

> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Jheng-Hong Yang, and Jimmy Lin. [Distilling Dense Representations for Ranking using Tightly-Coupled Teachers.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11386) arXiv:2010.11386, October 2020. 

Note that we often observe minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

## MS MARCO Passage Ranking

Summary of results:

| Condition                                              | MRR@10 |    MAP | Recall@1000 |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|-------:|-------:|------------:|
| TCT-ColBERT (brute-force index)                        | 0.3350 | 0.3416 |      0.9640 |
| TCT-ColBERT (HNSW index)                               | 0.3345 | 0.3410 |      0.9618 |
| TCT-ColBERT (brute-force index) + BoW BM25             | 0.3529 | 0.3594 |      0.9698 |
| TCT-ColBERT (brute-force index) + BM25 w/ doc2query-T5 | 0.3647 | 0.3711 |      0.9751 |

### Dense Retrieval

Dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERT, brute-force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.tct_colbert \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries tct_colbert-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

Note that to ensure maximum reproducibility, by default Pyserini uses pre-computed query representations that are automatically downloaded.
As an alternative, to perform "on-the-fly" query encoding, see additional instructions below.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.tsv
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3350
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool `trec_eval` to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.trec
```

Results:

```
map                     all     0.3416
recall_1000             all     0.9640
```

To perform on-the-fly query encoding with our [pretrained encoder model](https://huggingface.co/castorini/tct_colbert-msmarco/tree/main) use the option `--encoder castorini/tct_colbert-msmarco`.
Query encoding will run on the CPU by default.
To perform query encoding on the GPU, use the option `--device cuda:0`.

Dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERT, HNSW index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.tct_colbert.hnsw \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoded-queries tct_colbert-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.hnsw.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16
```

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.hnsw.tsv
```

Results:

  --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.hnsw.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.hnsw.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.hnsw.trec
```

Results:

```
map                     all     0.3411
recall_1000             all     0.9618
```

Follow the same instructions above to perform on-the-fly query encoding.
The caveat about minor differences in score applies here as well.

### Hybrid Dense-Sparse Retrieval

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  runs/run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert.d2q-t5.trec
```

Results:

```
map                   	all	0.3711
recall_1000           	all	0.9751
```

Follow the same instructions above to perform on-the-fly query encoding.
The caveat about minor differences in score applies here as well.

## MS MARCO Document Ranking

Summary of results:

| Condition                                              | MRR@100 |    MAP | Recall@100 |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|--------:|-------:|-----------:|
| TCT-ColBERT (brute-force index)                        |  0.3323 | 0.3323 |     0.8664 |
| TCT-ColBERT (brute-force index) + BoW BM25             |  0.3701 | 0.3701 |     0.9020 |
| TCT-ColBERT (brute-force index) + BM25 w/ doc2query-T5 |  0.3784 | 0.3784 |     0.9083 |

Although this is not described in the paper, we have adapted TCT-ColBERT to the MS MARCO document ranking task in a zero-shot manner.
Documents in the MS MARCO document collection are first segmented, and each segment is then encoded with the TCT-ColBERT model trained on trained on MS MARCO passages.
The score of a document is the maximum score of all passages in that document.

Dense retrieval using a brute force index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index msmarco-v1-doc.tct_colbert \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --encoded-queries tct_colbert-msmarco-doc-dev \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.tct_colbert.txt \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch-size 512 --threads 16 \
  --hits 1000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 100
```

Replace `--encoded-queries` by `--encoder castorini/tct_colbert-msmarco` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To compute the official metric MRR@100 using the official evaluation scripts:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_doc_eval \
  --judgments msmarco-doc-dev \
  --run runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.tct_colbert.txt
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @100: 0.3323
QueriesRanked: 5193
#####################
```

To compute additional metrics using `trec_eval`, we first need to convert the run to TREC format:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.tct_colbert.txt \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.tct_colbert.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.100 -mmap msmarco-doc-dev \
  runs/run.msmarco-doc.passage.tct_colbert.trec
```

Results:

```
map                   	all	0.3323
recall_100            	all	0.8664
```

Dense-sparse hybrid retrieval (without document expansion):
- dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERT, brute force index.
- sparse retrieval with BoW BM25 index.

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.hybrid \
  dense  --index msmarco-v1-doc.tct_colbert \
         --encoded-queries tct_colbert-msmarco-doc-dev \
  sparse --index msmarco-v1-doc-segmented \
  fusion --alpha 0.25 \
  run    --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
         --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.tct_colbert.bm25.tsv \
         --output-format msmarco \
         --batch-size 512 --threads 16 \
         --hits 1000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 100
```

Replace `--encoded-queries` by `--encoder castorini/tct_colbert-msmarco` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_doc_eval \
  --judgments msmarco-doc-dev \
  --run runs/run.msmarco-doc.tct_colbert.bm25.tsv
```

Results:

```
#####################
MRR @100: 0.3701

#####################
```

And TREC evaluation:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_msmarco_run_to_trec_run \
  --input runs/run.msmarco-doc.tct_colbert.bm25.tsv \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.tct_colbert.bm25.trec

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -mrecall.100 -mmap msmarco-doc-dev \
  runs/run.msmarco-doc.tct_colbert.bm25.trec
```

Results:

```
map                   	all	0.3701
recall_100            	all	0.9020
```

Dense-sparse hybrid retrieval (with document expansion):
- dense retrieval with TCT-ColBERT, brute force index.
- sparse retrieval with doc2query-T5 expanded index.

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.hybrid \
  dense  --index msmarco-v1-doc.tct_colbert \
         --encoded-queries tct_colbert-msmarco-doc-dev \
  sparse --index msmarco-v1-doc-segmented.d2q-t5 \

         --hits 1000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 100
```

Replace `--encoded-queries` by `--encoder castorini/tct_colbert-msmarco` for on-the-fly query encoding.

To evaluate:

# Pyserini: BM25 and RM3 Baselines for TREC 2021 Clinical Trials

This guide contains instructions for running BM25 and RM3 baselines on the [TREC 2021 Clinical Trials Track](http://www.trec-cds.org/2021.html).

## Data Prep

The guide requires the [development installation](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation) for additional resource that are not shipped with the Python module.

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the Clinical Trials documents and topics.

```bash
mkdir collections/trec-ct

wget http://www.trec-cds.org/2021_data/ClinicalTrials.2021-04-27.part1.zip -P collections/trec-ct
wget http://www.trec-cds.org/2021_data/ClinicalTrials.2021-04-27.part2.zip -P collections/trec-ct
wget http://www.trec-cds.org/2021_data/ClinicalTrials.2021-04-27.part3.zip -P collections/trec-ct
wget http://www.trec-cds.org/2021_data/ClinicalTrials.2021-04-27.part4.zip -P collections/trec-ct
wget http://www.trec-cds.org/2021_data/ClinicalTrials.2021-04-27.part5.zip -P collections/trec-ct

unzip 'collections/trec-ct/*.zip' -d collections/trec-ct

wget http://www.trec-cds.org/topics2021.xml -P tools/topics-and-qrels
```

Next we need to convert the documents into a json collection.

```
python scripts/trec-ct/convert_trec21_ct_to_json.py --input_dir collections/trec-ct --output_dir collections/trec-ct-json
```
The size of the output json file collections/trec-ct-json/trec21.json should be 2.4G.

Next we convert topics into tsv queries.

```
python scripts/trec-ct/convert_topic_xml_to_tsv.py --topics tools/topics-and-qrels/topics2021.xml \
                                                   --queries tools/topics-and-qrels/ctqueries2021.tsv
```

Build the index with the following command:

```
python -m pyserini.index --collection JsonCollection \
 --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 9 --input collections/trec-ct-json \
 --index indexes/lucene-index-ct --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw
```

On a modern desktop with an SSD, indexing takes around 5 minutes.
There should be a total of 375,580 documents indexed.

## Performing Retrieval on the Queries

Using bm25
```bash
python -m pyserini.search --topics tools/topics-and-qrels/ctqueries2021.tsv \
 --index indexes/lucene-index-ct \
 --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25.txt \
 --hits 1000 \
 --bm25 --k1 0.9 --b 0.4
```

Using bm25+rm3
```bash
python -m pyserini.search --topics tools/topics-and-qrels/ctqueries2021.tsv \
 --index indexes/lucene-index-ct \
 --output runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25.rm3.txt \
 --hits 1000 \
 --bm25 --rm3 --k1 0.9 --b 0.4
```

## Evaluation

After the run finishes, we can evaluate the results using the official TREC evaluation tool, `trec_eval`.

First download the qrels file.
```bash
$ wget --user <your_username> --password <your_password> https://trec.nist.gov/act_part/tracks/trials/2021-qrels.txt \
    -P tools/topics-and-qrels
```

For bm25, run this to get the RR and P@10 score:
```bash
$ tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -q -l 2 tools/topics-and-qrels/2021-qrels.txt runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25.txt
```

You should find these two lines in the output
```
recip_rank            	all	0.3015
P_10                  	all	0.1680
```

In addition, run this to get nDCG@10 score:
```bash
$ tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -q -m ndcg_cut tools/topics-and-qrels/2021-qrels.txt runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25.txt
```

You should see this line in the output
```
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.2923
```

For bm25+rm3, run this to get the RR and P@10 score:
```bash
$ tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -q -l 2 tools/topics-and-qrels/2021-qrels.txt runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25.rm3.txt
```

You should find these two lines in the output
```
recip_rank            	all	0.3659
P_10                  	all	0.2040
```

In addition, run this to get nDCG@10 score:
```bash
$ tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -q -m ndcg_cut tools/topics-and-qrels/2021-qrels.txt runs/run.msmarco-doc.bm25.rm3.txt
```

You should see this line in the output
```
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.3539
```

# Pyserini: BM25, RM3, and Rocchio Baselines for TREC 2022 Fair Ranking Track

This guide contains instructions for running BM25, RM3, and Rocchio baselines on the [TREC 2022 Fair Ranking Track](https://fair-trec.github.io/).

# Data Prep

This guide requires the [development installation](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation) for additional resource not shipped with the Python module.

First, we need to download the Fair Ranking dataset and the training topics and queries.

TREC 2022 Fair Ranking provides three different formats: plain, text, html.

In this example, only plain (7.1GB) will be used, but getting the baselines for the other formats is a nearly identical process.  
The text (16GB) and html (63GB) are significantly bigger than the plain collection so the following commands will also take longer for those collections.

To download the TREC 2022 Fair Ranking data (plain format) and topics:
```bash
mkdir collections/trec-fair-2022
wget https://data.boisestate.edu/library/Ekstrand/TRECFairRanking/corpus/trec_corpus_20220301_plain.json.gz -P collections/trec-fair-2022

wget https://data.boisestate.edu/library/Ekstrand/TRECFairRanking/2022/train_topics_meta.jsonl -P tools/topics-and-qrels
```

The other data formats may be downloaded optionally:
```bash
wget https://data.boisestate.edu/library/Ekstrand/TRECFairRanking/corpus/trec_corpus_20220301_html.json.gz -P collections/trec-fair-2022
wget https://data.boisestate.edu/library/Ekstrand/TRECFairRanking/corpus/trec_corpus_20220301_text.json.gz -P collections/trec-fair-2022
```

Then, we extract the data:
```bash
gzip -d collections/trec-fair-2022/*.gz
```

Next, we need to convert the data to indexing format:
```bash
python scripts/trec-fair/convert_trec_fair_2022_data_to_jsonl.py \
  --input collections/trec-fair-2022/trec_corpus_20220301_plain.json \
  --output collections/trec-fair-2022-jsonl/plain/trec_corpus_plain.jsonl
```
This takes about 6 minutes.

We also need to convert the topics into tsv format:
```bash
python scripts/trec-fair/convert_trec_fair_2022_queries_to_tsv.py \
  --input tools/topics-and-qrels/train_topics_meta.jsonl \
  --output tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_queries.tsv
```

Now, we can index the documents:
```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --input collections/trec-fair-2022-jsonl/plain \
  --index indexes/plain \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 9 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw
```
This takes about 1h. There should be 6,475,537 documents indexed.

# Performing Retrieval on Training Queries

Using BM25:
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/plain \
  --topics tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_queries.tsv \
  --output runs/run.plain.bm25.txt \
  --bm25 \
  --hits 500
```

Using BM25+RM3:
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/plain \
  --topics tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_queries.tsv \
  --output runs/run.plain.bm25.rm3.txt \
  --bm25 \
  --rm3 \
  --hits 500
```

Using BM25+Rocchio:
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/plain \
  --topics tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_queries.tsv \
  --output runs/run.plain.bm25.rocchio.txt \
  --bm25 \
  --rocchio \
  --hits 500
```

# Evaluation

To evaluate, we first need to convert the given relevant documents into qrels format:
```bash
python scripts/trec-fair/convert_trec_fair_2022_reldocs_to_qrels.py \
  --input tools/topics-and-qrels/train_topics_meta.jsonl \
  --output tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_qrels.txt
```

To evaluate BM25:
```bash
tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -mrecall.500 -mP.10 -mndcg -mndcg_cut.10 tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_qrels.txt runs/run.plain.bm25.txt
```
The output should have the following results:
```
P_10                  	all	0.6739
recall_500            	all	0.0138
ndcg                  	all	0.0241
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.6827
```

To evaluate BM25 + RM3:
```bash
tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -mrecall.500 -mP.10 -mndcg -mndcg_cut.10 tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_qrels.txt runs/run.plain.bm25.rm3.txt
```

The output should have the following results:
```
P_10                  	all	0.6717
recall_500            	all	0.0135
ndcg                  	all	0.0236
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.6972
```

To evaluate BM25+Rocchio:
```bash
tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -mrecall.500 -mP.10 -mndcg -mndcg_cut.10 tools/topics-and-qrels/trec_fair_2022_qrels.txt runs/run.plain.bm25.rocchio.txt
```

The output should have the following results:
```
P_10                  	all	0.6696
recall_500            	all	0.0141
ndcg                  	all	0.0247
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.6931
```

# Pyserini: BM25 Baseline for the TripClick Dataset

This guide contains instructions for running BM25 baselines for Document Retrieval on the [TripClick benchmark collection](https://tripdatabase.github.io/tripclick/).

**Note:** If you're instantiating an Ubuntu VM on your system or on cloud (AWS and GCP), try to provision enough resources as the tasks such as building the index could take some time to finish such as RAM > 8GB and storage > 100 GB (SSD).
This will prevent going back and fixing machine configuration again and again. If you have a configuration which works for Anserini on this task, it will work with Pyserini as well.

## Data Preparation

The guide requires the [development installation](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation) for additional resources that are not shipped with the Python module;

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, obtain the TripClick benchmark package, following instructions on the [TripClick benchmark collection web page](https://tripdatabase.github.io/tripclick/).

Uncompress the file: ```tar -xvfz benchmark.tar.gz```

Below we refer to the path to the uncompressed TripClick benchmark on your machine as ```~/../benchmark``` 

### Renaming Query Files
In the current version of TripClick benchmark query files have **.txt** file extensions. In order to be processed with Pyserini the extensions need to be changed
to **.trec**, as the files are written in TREC format. It is done with a simple console command. Move to ```~/../benchmark/qrels``` and ```~/../benchmark/topics``` and copy
the following to the command line for each of the two folders:
```bash
for f in *.txt; do 
    mv -- "$f" "${f%.txt}.trec"
done
```

### Indexing
The command below will create document index of the collection. The result file  will appear in ```indexes/``` folder of pyserini root named ```lucene-index-TRIP-doc```.
```bash
python -m pyserini.index
 -collection CleanTrecCollection \
 -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
 -threads 16 \
 -input ~/../benchmark/documents/ \
 -index indexes/lucene-index-TRIP-doc \
 -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeRaw
```

Note that the indexing program simply dispatches command-line arguments to an underlying Java program, and so we use the Java single dash convention, e.g., `-index` and not `--index`.
The script will automatically go through all files in ```~/../benchmark/documents/``` and extract the documents.

On a modern desktop with an SSD, indexing of the whole TripClick collection (~1.5m documents) takes around 15 minutes.

## Performing Retrieval

The Train, Validation and Test queries are in ```~/../benchmark/documents/```. As an example we make a run for the file ```topics.head.val.trec```:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search \
 --topics ~/../benchmark/topics/topics.head.val.trec \
 --index indexes/lucene-index-TRIP-doc \
 --output runs/run.trip.head.val.bm25tuned.trec \
 --bm25 \
 --output-format trec
```
the result will be saved in ```runs``` folder of pyserini root named ```un.trip.head.val.bm25tuned.trec```

For the purpose of reproduction of the reults shown in the [TripClick paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07901) we run BM25 with default parameters.

The option `--output-format msmarco` says to generate output in the trec output format.

## Evaluation with the TREC Official Evaluation Tool
We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool, `trec_eval`, to compute a multitude of metrics on the result.
For that we first need to convert the run file into TREC format:

Run the `trec_eval` tool:

```bash

# Pyserini: uniCOIL w/ TILDE on MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This page describes how to reproduce experiments using uniCOIL with TILDE document expansion on the MS MARCO passage corpus, as described in the following paper:

> Shengyao Zhuang and Guido Zuccon. [Fast Passage Re-ranking with Contextualized Exact Term
Matching and Efficient Passage Expansion.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08513) _arXiv:2108.08513_.

The original uniCOIL model is described here:

> Jimmy Lin and Xueguang Ma. [A Few Brief Notes on DeepImpact, COIL, and a Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2106.14807_.

In the original uniCOIL paper, doc2query-T5 is used to perform document expansion, which is slow and expensive.
As an alternative, Zhuang and Zuccon proposed to use the TILDE model to expand the documents instead, resulting in a faster and cheaper process that is just as effective.
For details of how to use TILDE to expand documents, please refer to the [TILDE repo](https://github.com/ielab/TILDE).
For additional details on the original uniCOIL design (with doc2query-T5 expansion), please refer to the [COIL repo](https://github.com/luyug/COIL/tree/main/uniCOIL).

In this guide, we start with a version of the MS MARCO passage corpus that has already been processed with uniCOIL + TILDE, i.e., gone through document expansion and term re-weighting.
Thus, no neural inference is involved.

## Data Prep

> You can skip the data prep and indexing steps if you use our pre-built indexes. Skip directly down to the "Retrieval" section below.

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO passage dataset with uniCOIL processing:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.tar -P collections/

tar xvf collections/msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.tar` is 3.9 GB and has MD5 checksum `1685aee10071441987ad87f2e91f1706`.

## Indexing

We can now index these docs:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion/ \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

The important indexing options to note here are `--impact --pretokenized`: the first tells Pyserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the uniCOIL tokens.

Upon completion, we should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD (using 12 threads, per above), indexing takes around 25 minutes.

## Retrieval

> If you've skipped the data prep and indexing steps and wish to directly use our pre-built indexes, use `--index msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde` in the command below.

We can now run retrieval using the `ielab/unicoil-tilde200-msmarco-passage` model available on Huggingface's model hub to encode the queries:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoder ielab/unicoil-tilde200-msmarco-passage \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we are using the transformer model to encode the queries on the fly using the CPU.
Note that the important option here is `--impact`, where we specify impact scoring. 
With these impact scores, query evaluation is already slower than bag-of-words BM25; on top of that we're adding neural inference on the CPU.
A complete run typically takes around 25 minutes.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv
```

The results should be as follows:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3495203984172459
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

There might be small differences in score due to non-determinism in neural inference; see [these notes](reproducibility.md) for detail.
The above score was obtained on Linux.

Alternatively, we can use pre-tokenized queries with pre-computed weights, which are already included in Pyserini.
We can run retrieval as follows:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset-unicoil-tilde \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we also specify `--impact` for impact scoring.
Since we're not applying neural inference over the queries, retrieval is faster, typically less than 10 minutes.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv
```

The results should be as follows:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.34957184927457136
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

Note that in this case, the results should be deterministic.

# Pyserini: uniCOIL w/ doc2query-T5 on MS MARCO V1

This guide describes how to reproduce the uniCOIL experiments in the following paper:

> Jimmy Lin and Xueguang Ma. [A Few Brief Notes on DeepImpact, COIL, and a Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2106.14807_.

And further detailed in:

[Document Expansions and Learned Sparse Lexical Representations for MS MARCO V1 and V2.](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Ma_etal_SIGIR2022.pdf) _Proceedings of the 45th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2022)_, July 2022.

Here, we start with versions of the MS MARCO V1 corpora that have already been processed with uniCOIL, i.e., we have applied model inference on every document and stored the output sparse vectors.

## Passage Ranking

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V1 passage](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v1-passage.html).
The passage ranking experiments here correspond to row (3b) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference.

### Corpus Download

We're going to use the Pyserini repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and unpack the corpus:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco-passage-unicoil.tar -P collections/
tar xvf collections/msmarco-passage-unicoil.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-passage-unicoil.tar` is 3.4 GB and has MD5 checksum `78eef752c78c8691f7d61600ceed306f`.

### Indexing

We can now index these docs:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-passage-unicoil/ \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-unicoil/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

The important indexing options to note here are `--impact --pretokenized`: the first tells Anserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the uniCOIL tokens.

Upon completion, we should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD (using 12 threads, per above), indexing takes around 15 minutes.

### Retrieval

We can now run retrieval using the `castorini/unicoil-msmarco-passage` model available on Huggingface's model hub to encode the queries:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-unicoil/ \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --encoder castorini/unicoil-msmarco-passage \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.unicoil.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we are using the transformer model to encode the queries on the fly using the CPU.
Note that the important option here is `--impact`, where we specify impact scoring.
With these impact scores, query evaluation is already slower than bag-of-words BM25; on top of that we're adding neural inference on the CPU.
A complete run typically takes around 30 minutes.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.unicoil.tsv

#####################
MRR @10: 0.3508734138354477

#####################
```

There might be small differences in score due to non-determinism in neural inference; see [these notes](reproducibility.md) for details.
The above score was obtained on Linux.

Alternatively, we can use pre-tokenized queries with pre-computed weights, which are already included in Pyserini.
We can run retrieval as follows:

```bash

  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-unicoil/ \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset-unicoil \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.unicoil.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --impact
```

Here, we also specify `--impact` for impact scoring.
Since we're not applying neural inference over the queries, speed is faster, typically less than 10 minutes.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.msmarco-passage.unicoil.tsv

#####################

#####################
```

Note that in this case, the results should be deterministic.

## Document Ranking

To reproduce these runs directly from our pre-built indexes, see our [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V1 doc](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v1-doc.html).
The document ranking experiments here correspond to row (3b) for pre-encoded queries, and a corresponding condition for on-the-fly query inference (although see note below for more details).

### Corpus Download

We're going to use the Pyserini repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and unpack the corpus:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tar -P collections/
tar xvf collections/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tar` is 19 GB and has MD5 checksum `6a00e2c0c375cb1e52c83ae5ac377ebb`.

### Indexing

We can now index these docs:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonVectorCollection \
  --input collections/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil/ \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil/ \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12 \
  --impact --pretokenized
```

The important indexing options to note here are `--impact --pretokenized`: the first tells Anserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the uniCOIL tokens.

The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD (using 12 threads, per above), indexing takes around an hour.

### Retrieval

We can now run retrieval:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev \
  --encoder castorini/unicoil-msmarco-passage \
  --output runs/run.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 100 \
  --impact
```

Here, we are using the transformer model to encode the queries on the fly using the CPU.
Note that the important option here is `--impact`, where we specify impact scoring.
With these impact scores, query evaluation is already slower than bag-of-words BM25; on top of that we're adding neural inference on the CPU.
A complete run can take around 40 minutes.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash
$ python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_doc_eval --judgments msmarco-doc-dev \
    --run runs/run.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tsv

#####################
MRR @100: 0.3530641289682811
QueriesRanked: 5193
#####################
```

There might be small differences in score due to non-determinism in neural inference; see [these notes](reproducibility.md) for details.
The above score was obtained on Linux.

Alternatively, we can use pre-tokenized queries with pre-computed weights, which are already included in Pyserini.
We can run retrieval as follows:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil \
  --topics msmarco-doc-dev-unicoil \

  --output-format msmarco \
  --batch 36 --threads 12 \
  --hits 1000 --max-passage --max-passage-hits 100 \
  --impact
```

Here, we also specify `--impact` for impact scoring.
Since we're not applying neural inference over the queries, speed is faster, typically less than 10 minutes.

The output is in MS MARCO output format, so we can directly evaluate:

```bash

#####################
MRR @100: 0.352997702662614
QueriesRanked: 5193
#####################
```

Note that in this case, the results should be deterministic.

A final detail: with MaxP and the need to generate runs to different depths, we can set `--hits` and `--max-passage-hits` differently.
Due to tie-breaking effects, we get slightly different results with different settings: see [Anserini experiments](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.md) for additional details.
Because of slightly different parameter settings, the results here do not exactly match the results in the [two-click reproduction matrix for MS MARCO V1 doc](https://castorini.github.io/pyserini/2cr/msmarco-v1-doc.html).

# Pyserini: Reproducing Vector PRF Results

This guide provides instructions to reproduce the Vector PRF in the following work and on all datasets and DR models available in Pyserini:

> Hang Li, Ahmed Mourad, Shengyao Zhuang, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon. [Pseudo Relevance Feedback with Deep Language Models and Dense Retrievers: Successes and Pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11044.pdf)

Starting with v0.12.0, you can reproduce these results directly from the [Pyserini PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/pyserini/).
Since dense retrieval depends on neural networks, Pyserini requires a more complex set of dependencies to use this feature.
See [package installation notes](../README.md#package-installation) for more details.

Note that we have observed minor differences in scores between different computing environments (e.g., Linux vs. macOS).
However, the differences usually appear in the fifth digit after the decimal point, and do not appear to be a cause for concern from a reproducibility perspective.
Thus, while the scoring script provides results to much higher precision, we have intentionally rounded to four digits after the decimal point.


## Summary
Here's how our results stack up against all available models and datasets in Pyserini:

#### MS MARCO Passage V1

The PRF does not perform well with sparse judgements like in MS MARCO, the results here are just complements.

## Reproducing Results

To reproduce the Average Vector PRF on different models, same command with different parameter values can be used:
```
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics topic \
    --index index \
    --encoder encoder \
    --batch-size 64 \
    --threads 12 \
    --output runs/run.average_prf3.trec \
    --prf-depth 3 \
    --prf-method avg
```

To reproduce the Rocchio Vector PRF on different models, similar with Average:
```
$ python -m pyserini.dsearch --topics topic \
    --index index \
    --encoder encoder \
    --batch-size 64 \
    --threads 12 \
    --output runs/run.rocchio_prf5_a0.4_b0.6.trec \
    --prf-depth 5 \
    --prf-method rocchio \
    --rocchio-alpha 0.4 \
    --rocchio-beta 0.6
```

For different models and datasets, the `--topics`, `--index`, and `--encoder` are different, since Pyserini has all these datasets available, we can pass in
different values to run on different datasets.

`--topics`: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TREC DL 2019 Passage: `dl19-passage` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TREC DL 2020 Passage: `dl20` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MS MARCO Passage V1: `msmarco-passage-dev-subset` <br />

`--index`: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANCE index with MS MARCO V1 passage collection: `msmarco-passage-ance-bf` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCT-ColBERT V1 index with MS MARCO V1 passage collection: `msmarco-passage-tct_colbert-bf` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCT-ColBERT V2 HN+ index with MS MARCO V1 passage collection: `msmarco-passage-tct_colbert-v2-hnp-bf` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DistillBERT KD index with MS MARCO V1 passage collection: `msmarco-passage-distilbert-dot-margin_mse-T2-bf` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DistillBERT Balanced index with MS MARCO V1 passage collection: `msmarco-passage-distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256-bf` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBERT index with MS MARCO V1 passage collection: `msmarco-passage-sbert-bf` <br />

_Note: TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, and MS MARCO Passage V1 use the same passage collection, so the index of the same model will be the same among these three datasets._<br />

`--encoder`: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANCE: `castorini/ance-msmarco-passage` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCT-ColBERT V1: `castorini/tct_colbert-msmarco` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCT-ColBERT V2 HN+: `castorini/tct_colbert-v2-hnp-msmarco` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DistillBERT KD: `sebastian-hofstaetter/distilbert-dot-margin_mse-T2-msmarco` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DistillBERT Balanced: `sebastian-hofstaetter/distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256-msmarco` <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBERT: `sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-v3` <br />

_Note: If you have pre-computed queries available, the `--encoder` can be replaced with `--encoded-queries` to avoid "on-the-fly" query encoding by passing in the path to your pre-computed query file. 
For example, Pyserini has the ANCE pre-computed query available for MS MARCO Passage V1, so instead of using `--encoder castorini/ance-msmarco-passage`,
one can use `--encoded-queries ance-msmarco-passage-dev-subset`. For ADORE model, you can only use `--encoded-queries`, otf encoding is not available._

With these parameters, one can easily reproduce the results above, for example, to reproduce `TREC DL 2019 Passage with ANCE Average Vector PRF 3` the command will be:
```
$ python -m pyserini.search.faiss --topics dl19-passage \
    --index msmarco-passage-ance-bf \
    --encoder castorini/ance-msmarco-passage \
    --batch-size 64 \
    --threads 12 \
    --output runs/run.ance.dl19-passage.average_prf3.trec \
    --prf-depth 3 \
    --prf-method avg
```

To reproduce `TREC DL 2019 Passage with ANCE Rocchio Vector PRF 5 Alpha 0.4 Beta 0.6`, the command will be:
```
$ python -m pyserini.search.faiss --topics dl19-passage \
    --index msmarco-passage-ance-bf \
    --encoder castorini/ance-msmarco-passage \
    --batch-size 64 \
    --threads 12 \
    --output runs/run.ance.dl19-passage.rocchio_prf5_a0.4_b0.6.trec \
    --prf-method rocchio \
    --prf-depth 5 \
    --rocchio-topk 5 \
    --rocchio-alpha 0.4 \
    --rocchio-beta 0.6
```

To evaluate, we use `trec_eval` built in Pyserini:

For TREC DL 2019, use this command to evaluate your run file:
```
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m map -m ndcg_cut.100 -m recall.1000 -l 2 dl19-passage runs/run.ance.dl19-passage.average_prf3.trec
map                 all     0.4247
ndcg_cut_100        all     0.5937
recall_1000         all     0.7739
```
Qrels file is available in Pyserini, so just replace the `runs/run.ance.dl19-passage.average_prf3.trec` with your own run file path to test your reproduced results.

Similarly, for TREC DL 2020:
```
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m map -m ndcg_cut.100 -m recall.1000 -l 2 dl20-passage runs/run.ance.dl20-passage.average_prf3.trec
map                 all     0.4325
ndcg_cut_100        all     0.5793
recall_1000         all     0.7909
```
Qrels file also available in Pyserini, just replace the `runs/run.ance.dl20-passage.average_prf3.trec` with your own run file path to test your reproduced results.

For MS MARCO Passage V1, no need to use `-l 2` option:
```
$ python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m map -m ndcg_cut.100 -m recall.1000 msmarco-passage-dev-subset runs/run.ance.msmarco-passage.average_prf3.trec
map                 all     0.3133
ndcg_cut_100        all     0.4247
recall_1000         all     0.9490
```
Qrels file already available, replace the `runs/run.ance.msmarco-passage.average_prf3.trec` with your own run file path to test your reproduced results.

# BGE-base for NFCorpus in Database Vector Stores

This guide contains instructions for running a BGE-base baseline for NFCorpus in the following databases:

+ [DuckDB](#duckdb)
+ [ChromaDB](#chromadb)
+ [Weaviate](#weaviate)

The following results can be obtained:

| **Retrieval Method**        | **nDCG@10** |
|:----------------------------|-------------|
| DuckDB BGE-Base (en-v1.5)   | 0.3808      |
| ChromaDB BGE-Base (en-v1.5) | 0.3808      |
| Weaviate BGE-Base (en-v1.5) | 0.3808      |

These results exactly match those [in Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-nfcorpus.md).

## Encoding

Assuming you have completed [this guide](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-nfcorpus.md) and fetched the data, we start by encoding the corpus and queries to obtain embeddings. 
We will feed these embeddings into the vector stores directly. 

```bash
mkdir indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5

python -m pyserini.encode \
  input   --corpus collections/nfcorpus/corpus.jsonl \
          --fields title text \
  output  --embeddings indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5 \
  encoder --encoder BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 --l2-norm \
          --device cpu \
          --pooling mean \
          --fields title text \
          --batch 32

mv indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/embeddings.jsonl indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/corpus_embeddings.jsonl

python -m pyserini.encode \
  input   --corpus collections/nfcorpus/queries.jsonl \
          --fields text \
  output  --embeddings indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5 \
  encoder --encoder BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 --l2-norm \
          --device cpu \
          --pooling mean \
          --fields text \
          --batch 32

mv indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/embeddings.jsonl indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/query_embeddings.jsonl
```

## DuckDB

Let's start with DuckDB. Install it with:

```bash
pip install duckdb
```

Then, we can connect to the database in Python. 

```python
import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect(":memory:")
```

Now, we initialize and load tables for our corpus and queries. We use DuckDB's float array to hold our embeddings.

```python
corpus_path = 'indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/corpus_embeddings.jsonl'
query_path = 'indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/query_embeddings.jsonl'

embd_dim = 0
import json
with open(corpus_path, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        row = json.loads(line.strip())
        embd_dim = len(row['vector'])
        break

conn.execute(f"""create table corpus (id varchar primary key, embedding float[{embd_dim}])""")
conn.execute(f"""create table query (id varchar primary key, embedding float[{embd_dim}])""")

def load_jsonl_to_table(file_path, table_name):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            row = json.loads(line.strip())
            a = conn.execute(f"""insert into {table_name} (id, embedding) values (?, ?)""", (row['id'], row['vector']))

load_jsonl_to_table(corpus_path, "corpus")
load_jsonl_to_table(query_path, "query")
```

Let's define a method for retrieving results for one query. 
We obtain the query embeddings with the query ID passed in and use DuckDB's ```array_cosine_similarity``` method to find the closest document embeddings to our query embeddings. 

```python
def embedding_search(query_id, top_n=5):
    query = f"""
    WITH query_embedding AS (
        SELECT embedding FROM query WHERE id = ?
    )
    SELECT corpus.id, 
            array_cosine_similarity(corpus.embedding, query_embedding.embedding) AS score
    FROM corpus, query_embedding
    ORDER BY score DESC
    LIMIT ?
    """
    return conn.execute(query, [query_id, top_n]).fetchall()
```

We call the retrieval method on all our queries to retrieve the top 1000 results for each. 

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
queries = conn.execute("SELECT id, embedding FROM query").fetchall()
run_tag = "bge_duckdb"

all_results = []

for query_id, query_string in tqdm(queries, desc=f"Processing {run_tag}", unit="query"):
    results = embedding_search(query_id, top_n=1000)
    for rank, (doc_id, score) in enumerate(results, 1):
        all_results.append((query_id, doc_id, score, rank))

all_results.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[3])) # sort by queryid, then rank

with open("runs/duckdb_bge_nfcorpus.txt", "w") as f:
    for query_id, doc_id, score, rank in all_results:
        a = f.write(f"{query_id} Q0 {doc_id} {rank} {score} {run_tag}\n")
```

To evaluate our results:

```
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m ndcg_cut.10 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels runs/duckdb_bge_nfcorpus.txt
```

which should yield the corresponding results in the table.


## ChromaDB

Now let's do the same thing, but in ChromaDB, an open source vector database. 
Start by installing it with: 

```bash
pip install chromadb
```

We connect to the database in Python and create a 'collection' for our corpus.

```python
import chromadb
client = chromadb.Client()
collection = client.create_collection("corpus")
```

Load the corpus embeddings into our ChromaDB collection. 

```python
import json
embeddings = []
ids = []
corpus_file = 'indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/corpus_embeddings.jsonl'
query_file = 'indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/query_embeddings.jsonl'

with open(corpus_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        row = json.loads(line.strip())
        embeddings.append(row['vector'])
        ids.append(row['id'])

collection.add(embeddings=embeddings, ids=ids)
```

Load the queries into Python.

```python
query_ids = []
query_embeddings = []

with open(query_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        row = json.loads(line.strip())
        query_ids.append(row['id'])
        query_embeddings.append(row['vector'])
```

We're ready to retrieve! 
While ChromaDB supports searching multiple queries at a time, all the queries at once is too much and throws an error, so we will search for one query at a time. 

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
run_tag = "bge_chroma"
all_results = []

for embd in tqdm(query_embeddings, desc=f"Processing {run_tag}", unit="query"):
    all_results.append(collection.query(query_embeddings=[embd], n_results=1000, include=['distances']))
```

The results aren't formatted very nicely straight out of the box, so we will reformat them before writing them to file. 

```python
formatted_results = []
for i in range(3237):
    for j in range(1000):
        formatted_results.append((query_ids[i], all_results[i]['ids'][0][j], 1 - all_results[i]['distances'][0][j], 1 + j))

with open("runs/chroma_bge_nfcorpus.txt", 'w') as f:
    for query_id, doc_id, score, rank in formatted_results:
        a = f.write(f"{query_id} Q0 {doc_id} {rank} {score} {run_tag}\n")
```

To evaluate our results:

```
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m ndcg_cut.10 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels runs/chroma_bge_nfcorpus.txt
```

which should yield the corresponding results in the table.


## Weaviate

Now let's do the same thing again, but in Weaviate, another open source vector database. 
This time, we will use its free cloud to store our embeddings, but it also supports running locally. 
Start by creating an account on its [website](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) and making a sandbox cluster. 
On your cluster's page, find the REST encdpoint and the admin API key and set them as environment variables.

```bash
export WEAVIATE_URL='...'
export WEAVIATE_API_KEY='...'
```

Next, install its Python client.

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client
```

Following this [guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart), we connect to our database and create a collection. 
We specify no vectorizer as we already have embeddings. 

```python
import weaviate, os
import weaviate.classes as wvc
import json

# Set these environment variables
URL = os.getenv("WEAVIATE_URL")
APIKEY = os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_KEY")

# Connect to Weaviate Cloud
client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
    cluster_url=URL,
    auth_credentials=wvc.init.Auth.api_key(APIKEY),
)

# Check connection
client.is_ready()

import weaviate.classes as wvc

# Create the collection. Weaviate's autoschema feature will infer properties when importing.
if client.collections.exists("corpus"):
    client.collections.delete("corpus")
documents = client.collections.create(
    "corpus",
    vectorizer_config=wvc.config.Configure.Vectorizer.none(),
)
```

Let's load the corpus into our collection. 
It's more efficient to add in batches, so we will load documents to a list first. 

```python
corpus_file = 'indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/corpus_embeddings.jsonl'
query_file = 'indexes/nfcorpus.bge-base-en-v1.5/query_embeddings.jsonl'
docs = []
with open(corpus_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        row = json.loads(line.strip())
        docs.append(wvc.data.DataObject(properties={"doc_id": row['id']}, vector=row['vector']))

documents.data.insert_many(docs)
```

We're ready to retrieve!    

```python
from weaviate.classes.query import MetadataQuery
from tqdm import tqdm
run_tag = "bge_weaviate"

with open(query_file, "r") as f:
    n_queries = sum(1 for _ in f)

all_results = []
query_ids = []
with open(query_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in tqdm(file, total=n_queries, desc=f"Processing {run_tag}", unit="query"):
        row = json.loads(line.strip())
        query_ids.append(row['id'])
        all_results.append(documents.query.near_vector(near_vector=row['vector'], limit=1000, return_metadata=MetadataQuery(distance=True)))
```

We need to reformat the results before we can write them to file. 

```python
formatted_results = []
for i in range(3237):
    for j in range(1000):
        formatted_results.append((query_ids[i], all_results[i].objects[j].properties['doc_id'], 1 - all_results[i].objects[j].metadata.distance, 1 + j))

run_tag = "bge_weaviate"
with open("runs/weaviate_bge_nfcorpus.txt", 'w') as f:
    for query_id, doc_id, score, rank in formatted_results:
        a = f.write(f"{query_id} Q0 {doc_id} {rank} {score} {run_tag}\n")

client.close()
```

To evaluate our results:

```
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m ndcg_cut.10 collections/nfcorpus/qrels/test.qrels runs/weaviate_bge_nfcorpus.txt
```

which should yield the corresponding results in the table.

# Pyserini: Reproducing DPR Results With Improved Wikipedia Corpus Variants

Dense passage retriever (DPR) is a dense retrieval method described in the following paper:

> Vladimir Karpukhin, Barlas Oğuz, Sewon Min, Patrick Lewis, Ledell Wu, Sergey Edunov, Danqi Chen, Wen-tau Yih. [Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.550/). _Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)_, pages 6769-6781, 2020.

We have replicated DPR results with our Wikipedia corpus variants.

Our own efforts are described in the paper: 
> Manveer Singh Tamber, Ronak Pradeep, and Jimmy Lin. "Pre-Processing Matters! Improved Wikipedia Corpora for Open-Domain Question Answering". ECIR 2023.

This guide provides instructions for retrieval on the `wiki-all-6-3-tamber` corpus variant and to reproduce the pre-processing to generate the corpora.
For end-to-end answer generation, please see [this guide](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle/blob/master/docs/experiments-wiki-corpora-fid.md) in our PyGaggle neural text ranking and question answering library.

In this guide, we start with retrieval. We provide the lucene index and the dense index for `wiki-all-6-3-tamber` prebuilt in Pyserini to make this possible. If you would like to download the corpora yourself or you would like to generate the lucene index yourself please refer to the [download-the-corpora](#download-the-corpora) section to start. Also, if you would like to reproduce dense retrieval, retrieval with a DPR model can be done in the Tevatron toolkit. Please follow the instructions from [Tevatron](https://github.com/texttron/tevatron/blob/main/examples/example_dpr.md) to do this. 

We make the $2^{nd}$ iteration DPR models available in HuggingFace🤗 for all corpus variants. The links to the models for wiki-all-6-3-tamber are:

[wiki-all-6-3-multi-dpr2-passage-encoder](https://huggingface.co/manveertamber/wiki-all-6-3-multi-dpr2-passage-encoder)  
[wiki-all-6-3-multi-dpr2-query-encoder](https://huggingface.co/manveertamber/wiki-all-6-3-multi-dpr2-query-encoder)  

## BM25 Retrieval
To run BM25 retrieval:

### Natural Questions
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --topics nq-test \
  --batch-size 20 \
  --threads 10 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.bm25.trec
```

After retrieval is complete, we can evaluate results as follows. The final command should output 2 values, the top-20 accuracy and the top-100 accuracy.

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics nq-test \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --input runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.bm25.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.bm25.json \
  --combine-title-text

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.bm25.json \
  --topk 20 100
```
Expected Output:
```
Top20   accuracy: 0.6665
Top100  accuracy: 0.8166
```
### TriviaQA
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --batch-size 20 \
  --threads 10 \
  --hits 1000 \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.bm25.trec
```

To get the results:
```bash

  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --input runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.bm25.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.bm25.json \
  --combine-title-text

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.bm25.json \
  --topk 20 100
```
Expected Output:
```
Top20   accuracy: 0.7832
Top100  accuracy: 0.8482
```

## DPR Retrieval

Retrieval can be performed in Pyserini as we make the encoded-queries for NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA and the dense index available in the wiki-all-6-3-tamber setting:

### Natural Questions
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wiki-all-6-3.dpr2-multi-retriever \
  --topics nq-test \
  --encoded-queries wiki-all-6-3-dpr2-multi-nq-test \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.dpr2.trec \
  --hits 1000 \
  --batch-size 72 --threads 36
```
To get the results:
```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics nq-test \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --input runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.dpr2.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.dpr2.json \
  --combine-title-text

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.dpr2.json \
  --topk 20 100
```
Expected Output:
```
Top20   accuracy: 0.8546
Top100  accuracy: 0.9175
```

### TriviaQA
```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --index wiki-all-6-3.dpr2-multi-retriever \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --encoded-queries wiki-all-6-3-dpr2-multi-dpr-trivia-test \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.dpr2.trec \
  --hits 1000 \
  --batch-size 72 --threads 36
```
To get the results:
```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --input runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.dpr2.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.dpr2.json \
  --combine-title-text

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.dpr2.json \
  --topk 20 100
```
Expected Output:
```
Top20   accuracy: 0.8192
Top100  accuracy: 0.8709
```

## Hybrid Retrieval
In the hybrid setting, we perform reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) using the rankings from the DPR model and BM25.

Note we use the --store-raw option in pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run because we will be using the .json files for [end-to-end answer generation in PyGaggle](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle/blob/master/docs/experiments-wiki-corpora-fid.md)

### Natural Questions
```bash
python -m pyserini.fusion \
  --runs runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.dpr2.trec \
         runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.bm25.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.hybrid.trec \
  --k 100
```
To get the results:
```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics nq-test \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --input runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.hybrid.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.hybrid.json \
  --store-raw \
  --combine-title-text

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.nq-test.hybrid.json \
  --topk 20 100
```
Expected Output:
```
Top20   accuracy: 0.8526
Top100  accuracy: 0.9302
```

### TriviaQA
```bash
python -m pyserini.fusion \
  --runs runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.dpr2.trec \
         runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.bm25.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.hybrid.trec \
  --k 100
```
To get the results:
```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.convert_trec_run_to_dpr_retrieval_run \
  --topics dpr-trivia-test \
  --index wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --input runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.hybrid.trec \
  --output runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.hybrid.json \
  --store-raw \
  --combine-title-text

python -m pyserini.eval.evaluate_dpr_retrieval \
  --retrieval runs/run.wiki-all-6-3.dpr-trivia-test.hybrid.json \
  --topk 20 100
```
Expected Output:
```
Top20   accuracy: 0.8420
Top100  accuracy: 0.8803
```

## Generate Corpora
We start with downloading the full December 20, 2018 Wikipedia XML dump: `enwiki-20181220-pages-articles.xml` from the Internet Archive: https://archive.org/details/enwiki-20181220. This is then pre-processed by WikiExtractor: https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor (making sure to modify the code to include lists as desired and replacing tables with the string "TABLETOREPLACE"). The following command is used for the corpora with no tables, infoboxes, or lists:
```bash
python -m wikiextractor.WikiExtractor \
  ../wiki/enwiki-20181220-pages-articles.xml  
  -o ../wiki_extractor_out/wiki-text/ \
  --json
```
and the same command (with modified code as described above) is used for the corpora with tables, infoboxes, and lists:
```bash
python -m wikiextractor.WikiExtractor \
  ../wiki/enwiki-20181220-pages-articles.xml  
  -o ../wiki_extractor_out/wiki-all/ \
  --json
```
The next step is using DrQA pre-processing: https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA/tree/main/scripts/retriever (again making sure to modify the code to not remove lists as desired) using the following commands:
```bash
python build_db.py \
  ../wiki_extractor_out/wiki-text/ \
  wiki-text.db \
  --preprocess prep_wikipedia.py
```
```bash
python build_db.py \
  ../wiki_extractor_out/wiki-all/ \
  wiki-all.db \
  --preprocess prep_wikipedia.py
```
We then apply the pre-processing script we make available in Pyserini to generate the different corpus variants. Note that this is a time consuming process and uses a lot of memory if tables are included. 

```bash
cd pyserini/scripts/

python wiki_generate_tsv_no_tables_lists.py \
  -db_path wiki-text.db \
  -output_path_6_3 wiki-text-6-3.tsv \
  -output_path_8_4 wiki-text-8-4.tsv \
  -output_path_100w wiki-text-100w.tsv 

python wiki_generate_tsv.py \
  -db_path wiki-all.db \
  -output_path_6_3 wiki-all-6-3.tsv \
  -output_path_8_4 wiki-all-8-4.tsv \
  -xml_path ../wiki/enwiki-20181220-pages-articles.xml
```

We take the .tsv files generated in the previous step and convert them to Pyserini and Anserini's JSONL format for indexing. 

## Download the Corpora

We make the different Wikipedia corpus variants available in [HuggingFace🤗](https://huggingface.co/datasets/castorini/odqa-wiki-corpora).

To download the corpora you may clone the repository. 
Make sure you have Git LFS set up by running 
```bash
git lfs install
```
Then to clone, run:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/castorini/odqa-wiki-corpora
```

The following instructions will continue with the wiki-all-6-3-tamber corpus. We use the NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA datasets for evaluation.

## Indexing
We index the jsonl file(s) using the following command. 
```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection MrTyDiCollection \
  --input odqa-wiki-corpora/wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --index indexes/wiki-all-6-3-tamber \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 12 \
  --storeRaw
```

# Pyserini: Detailed Installation Guide

Pyserini is built on Python 3.11 (other versions might work, but YMMV).
See [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) for a detailed list of dependencies.
At a high level:

+ Pyserini depends on [Anserini](http://anserini.io/), which is built on Lucene.
[PyJNIus](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius) is used to interact with the JVM. We depend on Java 21.
+ We need [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), and the [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) for "neural stuff".

A `pip` installation will automatically pull in major dependencies without any major issues 🤞:

```
pip install pyserini
```

The toolkit also has a number of optional dependencies:

```
pip install 'pyserini[optional]'
```

Notably, `faiss-cpu` is included as an optional dependency; the package can be tricky to install, which is why it is not included in the core dependencies.
It might be a good idea to install it yourself separately.

## PyPI Installation Walkthrough

Below is a step-by-step Pyserini installation guide based on Python 3.11.
We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and assume you have already installed it.
The following instructions are up to date as of June 2025 and _should_ work.

### Mac

If you're on a Mac with an M-series (i.e., ARM) processor:

```bash
conda create -n pyserini python=3.11 -y
conda activate pyserini

# Inside the new environment...
conda install -c anaconda wget -y
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk=21 maven -y

# from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# If you want the optional dependencies, otherwise skip
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu -y

# Good idea to always explicitly specify the latest version, found here: https://pypi.org/project/pyserini/
pip install pyserini==latest
# If you want the optional dependencies, otherwise skip; the temperamental packages are already installed at this point
# so should be smooth...
pip install 'pyserini[optional]==latest'
```

If you're on an Intel-based Mac, adjust the recipe accordingly for `osx-64`.

❗ If you get `numpy` v2 vs. v1 issues, you might need to explicitly downgrade `numpy`:

```
pip install numpy==1.26.4
```

For more details, see https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/3526

### Linux

Follow the recipe below:

```bash
conda create -n pyserini python=3.11 -y
conda activate pyserini

# Inside the new environment...
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk=21 maven -y

# from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# If you want the optional dependencies, otherwise skip
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu -y

# Good idea to always explicitly specify the latest version, found here: https://pypi.org/project/pyserini/
pip install pyserini==latest
# If you want the optional dependencies, otherwise skip; the temperamental packages are already installed at this point
# so should be smooth...
pip install 'pyserini[optional]==latest'
```

❗ If you get `numpy` v2 vs. v1 issues, you might need to explicitly downgrade `numpy`:

```
pip install numpy==1.26.4
```

For more details, see https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/3526

If you want to use UniIR models, it is also included in pyserini[optional].
However, you will need to make sure you also install the CLIP model with:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

### Verifying the Installation

By this point, Pyserini should have been installed.
It might be worthwhile to do a bit of sanity checking, per below.

To confirm that bag-of-words retrieval is working correctly, you can run the BM25 baseline on the MS MARCO passage ranking task:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --threads 16 --batch-size 128 \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --output run.msmarco-v1-passage.bm25-default.dev.txt \
  --bm25 --output-format msmarco

python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval \
  msmarco-passage-dev-subset run.msmarco-v1-passage.bm25-default.dev.txt
```

Expected Results:

```
MRR @10: 0.18741227770955546
```

To confirm that dense retrieval is working correctly with Lucene using an HNSW index:

``` bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --dense --hnsw \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.hnsw \
  --topics dl19-passage \
  --onnx-encoder BgeBaseEn15 \
  --output run.msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.lucene-hnsw.onnx.dl19.txt \
  --hits 1000 --ef-search 1000

python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -l 2 -m map dl19-passage \
  run.msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.lucene-hnsw.onnx.dl19.txt
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m ndcg_cut.10 dl19-passage \
  run.msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.lucene-hnsw.onnx.dl19.txt
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -l 2 -m recall.1000 dl19-passage \
  run.msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.lucene-hnsw.onnx.dl19.txt
```

Expected Results:

```
map                   	all	0.4486
ndcg_cut_10           	all	0.7016
recall_1000           	all	0.8441
```

To confirm that dense retrieval is working correctly with Faiss, run our TCT-ColBERT (v2) model on the MS MARCO passage ranking task:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.faiss \
  --topics msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --index msmarco-v1-passage.tct_colbert-v2-hnp \
  --encoded-queries tct_colbert-v2-hnp-msmarco-passage-dev-subset \
  --threads 12 --batch-size 384 \
  --output run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2.bf.tsv \
  --output-format msmarco

python -m pyserini.eval.msmarco_passage_eval \
  msmarco-passage-dev-subset run.msmarco-passage.tct_colbert-v2.bf.tsv
```

Expected Results:

```

```

If you've gotten to here, then everything should be working properly.

## Development Installation

If you're planning on just _using_ Pyserini, then the instructions above are fine.
However, if you're planning on contributing to the codebase or want to work with the latest not-yet-released features, you'll need a development installation.

Start the same way as the install above, but **don't** install `pip install pyserini`.

Instead, clone the Pyserini repo with the `--recurse-submodules` option to make sure the `tools/` submodule also gets cloned:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:castorini/pyserini.git --recurse-submodules
```

The `tools/` directory, which contains evaluation tools and scripts, is actually [this repo](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-tools), integrated as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) (so that it can be shared across related projects).
Change into the `pyserini` subdirectory and build as follows (you might get warnings, but okay to ignore):

```bash
cd tools/eval && tar xvfz trec_eval.9.0.4.tar.gz && cd trec_eval.9.0.4 && make && cd ../../..
cd tools/eval/ndeval && make && cd ../../..
```

Then, in the `pyserini` clone, use `pip` to add an ["editable" installation](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html), as follows:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Next, you'll need to clone and build [Anserini](http://anserini.io/).
It makes sense to put both `pyserini/` and `anserini/` in a common folder.
After you've successfully built Anserini, copy the fatjar, which will be `target/anserini-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar` into `pyserini/resources/jars/`.
As with the `pip` installation, a potential source of frustration is incompatibility among different versions of underlying dependencies.

You can confirm everything is working by running the unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

Assuming all tests pass, you should be ready to go!

## Troubleshooting Tips

+ The above guide handles JVM installation via conda. If you are using your own Java environment and get an error about Java version mismatch, it's likely an issue with your `JAVA_HOME` environmental variable.
In `bash`, use `echo $JAVA_HOME` to find out what the environmental variable is currently set to, and use `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/home` to change it to the correct path.
On a Linux system, the correct path might look something like `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21`.
Unfortunately, we are unable to offer more concrete advice since the actual path depends on your OS, which JDK you're using, and a host of other factors.
+ On Apple's M-series processors, make sure you've installed the ARM-based release of Conda instead of the Intel-based release.

## Internal Notes

At the University of Waterloo, we have two (CPU) development servers, `tuna` and `orca`.
Note that on these two servers, the root disk (where your home directory is mounted) doesn't have much space.
So, you need to set pyserini cache path to scratch space.

- For tuna, create the dir `/tuna1/scratch/{username}`
- For orca, create the dir `/store/scratch/{username}`

Set the `PYSERINI_CACHE` environment variable to point to the directory you created above.

# Pyserini: Prebuilt Indexes

Pyserini provides a number of prebuilt Lucene indexes.
To list what's available:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher
LuceneSearcher.list_prebuilt_indexes()

from pyserini.index.lucene import LuceneIndexReader
LuceneIndexReader.list_prebuilt_indexes()
```

It's easy initialize a searcher from a prebuilt index:

```python
searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')
```

You can use this simple Python one-liner to download the prebuilt index:

```
python -c "from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher; LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')"
```

The downloaded index will be in `~/.cache/pyserini/indexes/`.

It's similarly easy initialize an index reader from a prebuilt index:

```python
index_reader = LuceneIndexReader.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')
index_reader.stats()
```

The output will be:

```
{'total_terms': 174540872, 'documents': 528030, 'non_empty_documents': 528030, 'unique_terms': 923436}
```

Note that unless the underlying index was built with the `-optimize` option (i.e., merging all index segments into a single segment), `unique_terms` will show -1.
Nope, that's not a bug.

Pyserini also provides a number of prebuilt Faiss indexes.
To list what's available:

```python
from pyserini.search.faiss import FaissSearcher
FaissSearcher.list_prebuilt_indexes()
```

And to initialize a specific Faiss index:

```python
searcher = FaissSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5', None)
```

Below is a summary of the prebuilt indexes that are currently available.
Detailed configuration information for the prebuilt indexes are stored in [`pyserini/prebuilt_index_info.py`](../pyserini/prebuilt_index_info.py).

# Reproducibility: General Notes
 
## Reproducibility vs. Replicability

The terms "reproducibility" and "replicability" are often used in imprecise and confusing ways.
In the context of Pyserini, we use these terms as defined by ACM's [Artifact Review and Badging](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) Policy.
Note that the policy itself is confusing in that a previous version of the policy had the meaning of "reproducibility" and "replicability" swapped.

To be precise, per the policy:

+ Repeatability = same team, same experimental setup
+ Reproducibility = different team, same experimental setup
+ Replicability = different team, different experimental setup

In this context, if you are able to run our code and get the same results, then you have successfully _reproduced_ our results.
For the most part, replicability is not applicable in the context of Pyserini, because the term implies a different (i.e., non-Pyserini) implementation.

At the bottom of many pages you'll find a "Reproduction Log", which keeps track of users who have successfully reproduced the results reported on that page.
Note that we stretch the meaning of "same team" a bit in these logs: we still consider it a successful reproduction if another member of our research group is able to obtain the same results,
as long as the person was not the primary author of the code in question.

## Non-Determinism of Neural Inference

In our implementations of sparse learned retrieval models (i.e., models that use transformers to assign term weights to bag-of-words representations), we distinguish between two modes of retrieval:

1. Pre-tokenized queries with pre-computed weights. The query encoder is not used at retrieval time.
2. "On-the-fly" query encoding, which means we run inference on the queries using the query encoder at retrieval time.

In the first case, the results should be deterministic (i.e., scores should be exactly reproducible).

In the second case, for broader access, we perform inference on the CPU by default.
This additional neural inference increases query latency, and furthermore may introduce minor differences in the final scores due to a number of issues, for example, GPU vs. CPU inference.
We have additionally found that the operating system makes a difference, e.g., Linux vs. macOS, even if inference is performed on the CPU in both cases.
Usually, these differences are in the third decimal point in retrieval metrics.
This roughly characterizes the limits of reproducibility for this class of retrieval models.

For learned sparse retrieval models, inference is performed on documents and the weights are quantized as part of the corpus preparation process.
This process also introduces some amount of non-determinism, for example, depending, for example, on which GPU we use.
This means that even if the model is exactly the same, if we ran inference on the documents again, the weights might be slightly different.
And if we index these new representations and performed retrieval experiments, we're likely to get slightly different results.
Once again, these differences characterize the limits of reproducibility.

# --- usage-analyzer.md ---

# Pyserini: Usage of the Analyzer API

Pyserini exposes Lucene Analyzers in Python with the `Analyzer` class.
Below is a demonstration of these functionalities:

```python
from pyserini.analysis import Analyzer, get_lucene_analyzer

# Default analyzer for English uses the Porter stemmer:
analyzer = Analyzer(get_lucene_analyzer())
tokens = analyzer.analyze('City buses are running on time.')
print(tokens)
# Result is ['citi', 'buse', 'run', 'time']

# We can explicitly specify the Porter stemmer as follows:
analyzer = Analyzer(get_lucene_analyzer(stemmer='porter'))
tokens = analyzer.analyze('City buses are running on time.')
print(tokens)
# Result is same as above.

# We can explicitly specify the Krovetz stemmer as follows:
analyzer = Analyzer(get_lucene_analyzer(stemmer='krovetz'))
tokens = analyzer.analyze('City buses are running on time.')
print(tokens)
# Result is ['city', 'bus', 'running', 'time']

# Create an analyzer that doesn't stem, simply tokenizes:
analyzer = Analyzer(get_lucene_analyzer(stemming=False))
tokens = analyzer.analyze('City buses are running on time.')
print(tokens)
# Result is ['city', 'buses', 'running', 'time']
```

# Computer Canada (CC) Supplemental Instructions for Dense Retrieval

### Get started

For general CC setup, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/castorini/onboarding/edit/master/docs/cc-guide.md).

### Submitting jobs through SLURM using the interactive way

For dense retrieval, once you have `ssh`ed to the cc server (currently at the login node). To get into a compute node, the interactive way (get a shell) is using
the following command (make sure you have specified which resource account (jimmy's) to charge for your job, instructions are provided in [this link](https://github.com/castorini/onboarding/blob/master/docs/cc-guide.md#submitting-jobs-through-slurm)):

 `srun --mem=128G --cpus-per-task=32 --time=24:0:0 --pty zsh`
 
Change `zsh` to `bash` if you prefer bash and add this argument `--gres=gpu:<device_name>:<number_of_devices>` if you need a GPU where `<device_name>` can be `v100l`
for example. Please adjust numbers in the argument accordingly to your usage.

Once you are in a compute node (the above waiting process usually takes some time), use `squeue -u <your_user_name>` to check your status. Make sure you have cleared the `PYTHON_PATH` environment variable `export PYTHON_PATH=`

Refer to [this link](https://github.com/castorini/onboarding/blob/master/docs/cc-guide.md#create-a-virtual-environment) to create a conda environment. Once you have created
a new environment in Conda, install all packages you need using conda-forge repo: `conda install -c conda-forge <package_name>`. If you get `ImportError:C extension: /lib64/libc.so.6`, please install the 
package again using the previous command.

Before you run any pyserini dense retrieval task, please make sure you have installed the newest pyserini (`pip install .` in the root directory of pyserini)

If you have any question using CC on dense retrieval, please feel free to msg me (Arthur Chen@Slack) or check CC documentation


# --- usage-collection.md ---

# Pyserini: Usage of the Collection API

The `collection` classes provide interfaces for iterating over a collection and processing documents.
Here's a demonstration on the CACM collection:

```bash
wget -O cacm.tar.gz https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/src/main/resources/cacm/cacm.tar.gz?raw=true
mkdir collections/cacm
tar xvfz cacm.tar.gz -C collections/cacm
rm cacm.tar.gz
```

Let's iterate through all documents in the collection:

```python
from pyserini import collection, index

collection = collection.Collection('HtmlCollection', 'collections/cacm/')
generator = index.Generator('DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator')

for (i, fs) in enumerate(collection):
    for (j, doc) in enumerate(fs):
        parsed = generator.create_document(doc)
        docid = parsed.get('id')            # FIELD_ID
        raw = parsed.get('raw')             # FIELD_RAW
        contents = parsed.get('contents')   # FIELD_BODY
        print('{} {} -> {} {}...'.format(i, j, docid, contents.strip().replace('\n', ' ')[:50]))
```


# --- usage-fetch.md ---

# Pyserini: Fetching Document Content

## Fetching a Document from a Lucene Index

A commonly used feature in Pyserini is to fetch a document (i.e., its text) given its `docid`.
A sparse (Lucene) index can be configured to include the raw document text, in which case the `doc()` method can be used to fetch the document:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-v1-passage')
doc = searcher.doc('7157715')
```

❗ Note that `doc` is an instance of `pyserini.index.lucene.Document`, _not_ `org.apache.lucene.document.Document`.
See below for more details.

From `doc`, you can access its `contents` as well as its `raw` representation.
The `contents` hold the representation of what's actually indexed; the `raw` representation is usually the original "raw document".
A simple example can illustrate this distinction: for an article from CORD-19, `raw` holds the complete JSON of the article, which obviously includes the article contents, but has metadata and other information as well.
The `contents` contain extracts from the article that's actually indexed (for example, the title and abstract).
In most cases, `contents` can be deterministically reconstructed from `raw`.
When building the index, we specify flags to store `contents` and/or `raw`; it is rarely the case that we store both, since that would be a waste of space.

In the case of the prebuilt `msmarco-v1-passage` index, we only store `raw`.
Thus:

```python
# Document contents: what's actually indexed.
# Note, this is not stored in the prebuilt msmacro-v1-passage index.
doc.contents()
                                                                                                   
# Raw document
doc.raw()
```

As you'd expected, `doc.id()` returns the `docid`, which is `7157715` in this case.
Finally, `doc.lucene_document()` returns the underlying Lucene `Document` (i.e., a Java object).
With that, you get direct access to the complete Lucene API for manipulating documents.

Since each text in the MS MARCO passage corpus is a JSON object, we can read the document into Python and manipulate:

```python
import json
json_doc = json.loads(doc.raw())

json_doc['contents']
# 'contents' of the document:
# A Lobster Roll is a bread roll filled with bite-sized chunks of lobster meat...
```

## Fetching a Document from a Search Result

Another common use case is fetching the document from a search result (i.e., hit).
For example:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

lucene_bm25_searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-v1-passage')
hits = lucene_bm25_searcher.search('what is a lobster roll?')
```

The `hits` object is an array of `io.anserini.search.ScoredDoc` objects, defined [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/src/main/java/io/anserini/search/ScoredDoc.java).
Thus, the accessible fields of a hit are:

```python
# The docid from the collection, type string.
hits[0].docid
# Lucene's internal docid, type int.
hits[0].lucene_docid
# Score, type float
hits[0].score
# Raw Lucene document, type org.apache.lucene.document.Document
hits[0].lucene_document
```

You can examine the actual text of the first hit, as follows:

```python
hits[0].lucene_document.get('raw')
```

The result is the actual raw document, which is a JSON object in this case.

❗ Note that `hits[0].lucene_document` has type `org.apache.lucene.document.Document`, _not_ `pyserini.index.lucene.Document`.

You can easily wrap `org.apache.lucene.document.Document` in `pyserini.index.lucene.Document`, e.g.,

```python
from pyserini.index.lucene import Document

doc = Document(hits[0].lucene_document)
```

After which all the convenience methods work:

```python
# Raw document
doc.raw()

import json
json_doc = json.loads(doc.raw())

json_doc['contents']
# 'contents' of the document:
# Cookbook: Lobster roll Media: Lobster roll A lobster-salad style roll from...
```

## The Nuances of `docid` Assignment

Every document has a `docid`, of type string, assigned by the collection it is part of.

❗ Even if the "natural" type of the `docid` is an integer, as is the case with the MS MARCO passage corpus, the type is _always_ a string in this context.

In addition, Lucene assigns each document a unique internal id (confusingly, Lucene also calls this the `docid`), which is an integer numbered sequentially starting from zero to one less than the number of documents in the index.
This can be a source of confusion but the meaning is usually clear from context.
Where there may be ambiguity, we refer to the external collection `docid` and Lucene's internal `docid` to be explicit.
Programmatically, the two are distinguished by type: the first is a string and the second is an integer.

As an important side note, Lucene's internal `docid`s are _not_ stable across different index instances.
That is, in two different index instances of the same collection, Lucene is likely to have assigned different internal `docid`s for the same document.
This is because the internal `docid`s are assigned based on document ingestion order; this will vary due to thread interleaving during indexing (which is usually performed on multiple threads).

The `doc` method in `searcher` takes either a string (interpreted as an external collection `docid`) or an integer (interpreted as Lucene's internal `docid`) and returns the corresponding document.
Thus, a simple way to iterate through all documents in the collection (and for example, print out its external collection `docid`) is as follows:

```python
for i in range(searcher.num_docs):
    print(searcher.doc(i).docid())
```

Note that you don't actually want to do this, since it'll take a long time to print `docid`s for 8.8M passages...

# Pyserini: Indexing Custom Corpora

In addition to searching indexes on standard corpora in IR and NLP research that we've already built for you, with Pyserini you can index and search your own corpora.

+ [Building a BM25 Index (Direct Java Implementation)](#building-a-bm25-index-direct-java-implementation)
+ [Building a BM25 Index (Embeddable Python Implementation)](#building-a-bm25-index-embeddable-python-implementation)
+ [Building a Sparse Vector Index](#building-a-sparse-vector-index)
+ [Building a Dense Vector Index](#building-a-dense-vector-index)

## Building a BM25 Index (Direct Java Implementation)

To build sparse (i.e., Lucene inverted indexes) on your own document collections, follow the instructions below.

Pyserini (via Anserini) provides ingestors for document collections in many different formats.
The simplest, however, is the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "doc1",
  "contents": "this is the contents."
}
```

A document is simply comprised of two fields, a `docid` and `contents`.
Pyserini accepts collections comprised of these documents organized in three different ways:

+ Folder with each JSON in its own file, like [this](../tests/resources/sample_collection_json).
+ Folder with files, each of which contains an array of JSON documents, like [this](../tests/resources/sample_collection_json_array).
+ Folder with files, each of which contains a JSON on an individual line, like [this](../tests/resources/sample_collection_jsonl) (often called JSONL format).

So, the quickest way to get started is to write a script that converts your documents into the above format.
Then, you can invoke the indexer (here, we're indexing JSONL, but any of the other formats work as well):

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --input tests/resources/sample_collection_jsonl \
  --index indexes/sample_collection_jsonl \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 1 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw
```

Three options control the type of index that is built:

+ `--storePositions`: builds a standard positional index
+ `--storeDocvectors`: stores doc vectors (required for relevance feedback)
+ `--storeRaw`: stores raw documents

If you don't specify any of the three options above, Pyserini builds an index that only stores term frequencies.
This is sufficient for simple "bag of words" querying (and yields the smallest index size).

Once indexing is done, you can use `SimpleSearcher` to search the index:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher('indexes/sample_collection_jsonl')
hits = searcher.search('document')

for i in range(len(hits)):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:4} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

You should get something like the following:

```
 1 doc2 0.25620
 2 doc3 0.23140
```

If you want to perform a batch retrieval run (e.g., directly from the command line), organize all your queries in a tsv file, like [here](../tests/resources/sample_queries.tsv).
The format is simple: the first field is a query id, and the second field is the query itself.
Note that the file extension _must_ end in `.tsv` so that Pyserini knows what format the queries are in.

Then, you can run:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/sample_collection_jsonl \
  --topics tests/resources/sample_queries.tsv \
  --output run.sample.txt \
  --bm25
```

The output:

```bash
$ cat run.sample.txt
1 Q0 doc2 1 0.256200 Anserini
1 Q0 doc3 2 0.231400 Anserini
2 Q0 doc1 1 0.534600 Anserini
3 Q0 doc1 1 0.256200 Anserini
3 Q0 doc2 2 0.256199 Anserini
4 Q0 doc3 1 0.483000 Anserini
```

Note that output run file is in standard TREC format.

You can also add extra fields in your documents when needed, e.g. text features.
For example, the [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities) Named Entity Recognition (NER) result of `contents` could be stored as an additional field `NER`.

```json
{
  "id": "doc1",
  "contents": "The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science.",
  "NER": {
            "ORG": ["The Manhattan Project"],
            "MONEY": ["World War II"]
         }
}
```

What about non-English documents?

Instructions for indexing and searching non-English corpora is quite similar to English corpora, so check out the above guide first.

Here's a [sample collection in Chinese](../tests/resources/sample_collection_jsonl_zh) in the JSONL format.
To index:

```bash
python -m pyserini.index.lucene \
  --collection JsonCollection \
  --input tests/resources/sample_collection_jsonl_zh \
  --language zh \
  --index indexes/sample_collection_jsonl_zh \
  --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  --threads 1 \
  --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw
```

The only difference here is that we specify `--language zh` using the ISO language code.

Using `LuceneSearcher` to search the index:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher('indexes/sample_collection_jsonl_zh')
searcher.set_language('zh')
hits = searcher.search('滑铁卢')

for i in range(len(hits)):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:4} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

The only difference is to use `set_language` to set the language.

To perform a batch run:

```bash
python -m pyserini.search.lucene \
  --index indexes/sample_collection_jsonl_zh \
  --topics tests/resources/sample_queries_zh.tsv \
  --output run.sample_zh.txt \
  --language zh \
  --bm25
```

Here's what the [query file](../tests/resources/sample_queries_zh.tsv) looks like, in tsv.
Once again, add `--language zh`.

And the expected output:

```bash
$ cat run.sample_zh.txt
1 Q0 doc1 1 1.337800 Anserini
2 Q0 doc3 1 0.119100 Anserini
2 Q0 doc2 2 0.092600 Anserini
2 Q0 doc1 3 0.091100 Anserini
```

## Building a BM25 Index (Embeddable Python Implementation)

To be added...

## Building a Sparse Vector Index

To be added...

## Building a Dense Vector Index

To build dense indexes (e.g., Faiss indexes) on your own document collections, follow the instructions below.

To build the dense index, Pyserini allows to either directly build Faiss Flat index via `pyserini.encode` with `output --to-faiss`, 
or first encode collections into vectors via `pyserini.encode`, then build various types of Faiss index via `pyserini.index.faiss` based on the encoded collections. 
 
To use the `pyserini.encode`, the input should be in JSONL format. 
Each line is a json dictionary containing two fields, i.e .`id` and `contents`.
- `id` is the document id in string.
- `contents` contains all the fields of the documents. By default, Pyserini expects the fields in contents are separated by `\n`. The field's boundary can be controled using `--delimiter` argument under `input`, see the example script below.

For example, the following document has *four* fields in contents, `url`, `title`, `text` and `expand`,
where the value of each field is `"www.url.com`, `title`, `this is the contents`, and `document expansion` respectively.
```json
{
  "id": "doc1",
  "contents": "www.url.com\ntitle\nthis is the contents.\ndocument expansion"
}
```
The `contents` can also only have one fields, as in the `tests/resources/simple_cacm_corpus.json` sample file:
```json
{
  "id": "CACM-2636",
  "contents": "Generation of Random Correlated Normal ... \n"
}
```

With the collection in the correct format, we can now encode documents with Dense encoders:
```bash
python -m pyserini.encode \
  input   --corpus tests/resources/simple_cacm_corpus.json \
          --fields text \  # fields in collection contents
          --delimiter "\n" \
          --shard-id 0 \   # The id of current shard. Default is 0
          --shard-num 1 \  # The total number of shards. Default is 1
  output  --embeddings path/to/output/dir \
          --to-faiss \
  encoder --encoder castorini/tct_colbert-v2-hnp-msmarco \
          --fields text \  # fields to encode, they must appear in the input.fields
          --batch 32 \
          --fp16  # if inference with autocast()
```
* the `--corpus` can be either be a json file, or a directory that contains multiple json files
* with `--to-faiss`, the generated embeddings will be stored as FaissIndexIP directly.  Otherwise it will be stored in `.jsonl` format.  If in `.jsonl` format, each line contains following info:
```json
{
  "id": "CACM-2636",
  "contents": "Generation of Random Correlated Normal ... \n"},
  "vector": [0.126, ..., -0.004]
}
```
* The `shard-id` and `shard-num` arguments are for speeding up the encoding, where the `shard-num` controls the total shard you want to segment the collection into, and the `shard-id` is the id of the current shard to encode. For example, if `shard-num` is 4 and `shard-id` is 0, the command would create a sub-index for the first 1/4 of the collection. Then you can run 4 process on 4 gpu to speed up the process by 4 times.  Once it's done, you can merge the sub-indexes together by:
```bash
python -m pyserini.index.merge_faiss_indexes --prefix indexes/dindex-sample-dpr-multi- --shard-num 4
```

#### Encode documents with Sparse encoder

```bash
python -m pyserini.encode \
  input   --corpus tests/resources/simple_cacm_corpus.json \
          --fields text \
  output  --embeddings path/to/output/dir \
  encoder --encoder castorini/unicoil-msmarco-passage \
          --fields text \
          --batch 32 \
          --fp16 # if inference with autocast()
```
The output will be stored in jsonl format. Each line contains following info:
```json
{
  "id": "CACM-2636",
  "contents": "Generation of Random Correlated Normal ... \n",
  "vector": {"generation":  0.12, "of":  0.1, "random":  0, ...}
}
```

Once the collections are encoded into vectors,
we can start to build the index.

Pyserini supports four types of index so far:
1. [HNSWPQ](https://faiss.ai/cpp_api/struct/structfaiss_1_1IndexHNSWPQ.html#struct-faiss-indexhnswpq)
```bash
python -m pyserini.index.faiss \
  --input path/to/encoded/corpus \  # Folder containing file either in the Faiss or the jsonl format
  --output path/to/output/index \
  --hnsw \
  --pq
```

2. [HNSW](https://faiss.ai/cpp_api/struct/structfaiss_1_1IndexHNSW.html#struct-faiss-indexhnsw)
```bash
python -m pyserini.index.faiss \
  --input path/to/encoded/corpus \  # The folder containing file either in the Faiss or the jsonl format
  --output path/to/output/index \
  --hnsw
```

3. [PQ](https://faiss.ai/cpp_api/struct/structfaiss_1_1IndexPQ.html)
```bash
python -m pyserini.index.faiss \
  --input path/to/encoded/corpus \  # The folder containing file either in the Faiss or the jsonl format
  --output path/to/output/index \
  --pq
```
4. [Flat](https://faiss.ai/cpp_api/struct/structfaiss_1_1IndexFlat.html)

This command is for converting the `.jsonl` format into Faiss flat format,
and generates the same files with `pyserini.encode` with `--to-faiss` specified.
```bash
python -m pyserini.index.faiss \
  --input path/to/encoded/corpus \  # The folder containing file in jsonl format
  --output path/to/output/index
```

Once the index is built, you can use `FaissSearcher` to search in the collection:
```python
from pyserini.search.faiss import FaissSearcher

searcher = FaissSearcher(
    'indexes/dindex-sample-dpr-multi',
    'facebook/dpr-question_encoder-multiset-base'
)
hits = searcher.search('what is a lobster roll')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```


# --- usage-indexreader.md ---

# Pyserini: Usage of the Index Reader API

The `LuceneIndexReader` class provides methods for accessing and manipulating an inverted index.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Be aware whether a method takes or returns _analyzed_ or _unanalyzed_ terms.
"Analysis" refers to processing by a Lucene `Analyzer`, which typically includes tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, etc.
For example, if a method expects the unanalyzed term and is called with an analyzed term, it'll reanalyze the term; it is sometimes the case that analysis of an already analyzed term is also a valid term, which means that the method will return incorrect results without triggering any warning or error.

Initialize the class as follows:

```python
from pyserini.index.lucene import LuceneIndexReader

# Initialize from a pre-built index:
index_reader = LuceneIndexReader.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')

# Alternatively, if you already have the index locally, initialize from an index path:
index_reader = LuceneIndexReader('indexes/index-robust04-20191213/')
```

## How do I iterate over index terms and access term statistics?

Use `terms()` to grab an iterator over all terms in the collection, i.e., the dictionary.
Note that these terms are _analyzed_.
Here, we only print out the first 10:

```python
import itertools
for term in itertools.islice(index_reader.terms(), 10):
    print(f'{term.term} (df={term.df}, cf={term.cf})')
```

How to fetch term statistics for a particular (unanalyzed) query term, "cities" in this case:

```python
term = 'cities'

# Look up its document frequency (df) and collection frequency (cf).
# Note, we use the unanalyzed form:
df, cf = index_reader.get_term_counts(term)
print(f'term "{term}": df={df}, cf={cf}')
```

What if we want to fetch term statistics for an analyzed term?
This can be accomplished by setting `Analyzer` to `None`:

```python
term = 'cities'

# Analyze the term.
analyzed = index_reader.analyze(term)
print(f'The analyzed form of "{term}" is "{analyzed[0]}"')

# Skip term analysis:
df, cf = index_reader.get_term_counts(analyzed[0], analyzer=None)
print(f'term "{term}": df={df}, cf={cf}')
```

## How do I traverse postings?

Here's how to fetch and traverse postings:

```python
# Fetch and traverse postings for an unanalyzed term:
postings_list = index_reader.get_postings_list(term)
for posting in postings_list:
    print(f'docid={posting.docid}, tf={posting.tf}, pos={posting.positions}')

# Fetch and traverse postings for an analyzed term:
postings_list = index_reader.get_postings_list(analyzed[0], analyzer=None)
for posting in postings_list:
    print(f'docid={posting.docid}, tf={posting.tf}, pos={posting.positions}')
```

## How do I access and manipulate term vectors?

Here's how to fetch the document vector for a document:

```python
doc_vector = index_reader.get_document_vector('FBIS4-67701')
print(doc_vector)
```

The result is a dictionary where the keys are the analyzed terms and the values are the term frequencies.

If you want to know the positions of each term in the document, you can use `get_term_positions`:
```python
term_positions = index_reader.get_term_positions('FBIS4-67701')
print(term_positions)
```
The result is a dictionary where the keys are the analyzed terms and the values are the positions every term occur in the document.

If you want to reconstruct the document using the position information, you can do this:
```python
doc = []
for term, positions in term_positions.items():
    for p in positions:
        doc.append((term,p))

doc = ' '.join([t for t, p in sorted(doc, key=lambda x: x[1])])
print(doc)
```
The reconstructed document contains analyzed terms while [doc.contents()](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/tree/master#how-do-i-fetch-a-document) contains unanalyzed terms.

## How do I compute the tf-idf or BM25 score of a document?

Building on the instructions above, to compute the tf-idf representation of a document, do something like this:

```python
tf = index_reader.get_document_vector('FBIS4-67701')
df = {term: (index_reader.get_term_counts(term, analyzer=None))[0] for term in tf.keys()}
```

The two dictionaries will hold tf and df statistics; from those it is easy to assemble into the tf-idf representation.
However, often the BM25 score is better than tf-idf.
To compute the BM25 score for a particular term in a document:

```python
# Note that the keys of get_document_vector() are already analyzed, we set analyzer to be None.
bm25_score = index_reader.compute_bm25_term_weight('FBIS4-67701', 'citi', analyzer=None)
print(bm25_score)

# Alternatively, we pass in the unanalyzed term:
bm25_score = index_reader.compute_bm25_term_weight('FBIS4-67701', 'city')
print(bm25_score)
```

And so, to compute the BM25 vector of a document:

```python
tf = index_reader.get_document_vector('FBIS4-67701')
bm25_vector = {term: index_reader.compute_bm25_term_weight('FBIS4-67701', term, analyzer=None) for term in tf.keys()}
```

Another useful feature is to compute the score of a _specific_ document with respect to a query, with the `compute_query_document_score` method.
For example:

```python
query = 'hubble space telescope'
docids = ['LA071090-0047', 'FT934-5418', 'FT921-7107', 'LA052890-0021', 'LA070990-0052']

for i in range(0, len(docids)):
    score = index_reader.compute_query_document_score(docids[i], query)
    print(f'{i+1:2} {docids[i]:15} {score:.5f}')
```

The scores should be very close (rounding at the 4th decimal point) to the results above, but not _exactly_ the same because `search` performs additional score manipulation to break ties during ranking.

## How do I access basic index statistics?

Simple!

```python
index_reader.stats()
```

Output is something like this:

```
{'total_terms': 174540872,
 'documents': 528030,
 'non_empty_documents': 528030,
 'unique_terms': 923436}
```

Note that unless the underlying index was built with the `-optimize` option (i.e., merging all index segments into a single segment), `unique_terms` will show -1.
Nope, that's not a bug.

## How do I dump out BM25 vectors for every document?

Here's how to dump out all the document vectors with BM25 weights in Pyserini's JSONL vector format:
```python
# You must specify a file path for the .jsonl file
index_reader.dump_documents_BM25('collections/cacm_documents_bm25_dump.jsonl')
```

Output in the .jsonl file is something like this:
```
{"id": "CACM-0001", "vector": {"22": 1.2635996341705322, "perli": 2.813838481903076, "28": 1.4853038787841797, "ca581203": 3.889439582824707, "languag": 1.0462608337402344, "algebra": 1.9220843315124512, "preliminari": 2.5628812313079834, "3184": 1.5415544509887695, "196": 2.208385944366455, "210": 1.8753266334533691, "398": 1.9435224533081055, "410": 1.9893245697021484, "214": 2.6431477069854736, "91": 2.813838481903076, "decemb": 1.0904579162597656, "1958": 2.217474937438965, "1978": 0.03820383548736572, "53": 2.0858259201049805, "intern": 2.1584203243255615, "cacm": 0.00023746490478515625, "samelson": 3.230319023132324, "1273": 2.6431477069854736, "j": 0.6906000375747681, "k": 1.413696527481079, "march": 0.3245110511779785, "164": 2.774796485900879, "165": 3.0729784965515137, "1": 1.9030036926269531, "100": 2.3613317012786865, "123": 1.7414944171905518, "642": 2.0955820083618164, "1883": 2.7047135829925537, "1982": 2.1930222511291504, "324": 2.614957094192505, "5": 0.00014519691467285156, "6": 0.8225016593933105, "205": 1.8882520198822021, "8": 1.1494452953338623, "jb": 0.033278584480285645, "report": 1.7513933181762695, "669": 1.8384160995483398, "pm": 0.18731093406677246, "43": 1.9893245697021484}}

...
```

## How do I quantize vectors of weights?

Given vectors of weights in Pyserini's JSONL vector format, the weights can be quantized as below:
```python
dump_file_path = 'collections/cacm_documents_bm25_dump.jsonl'
quantized_file_path = 'collections/cacm_documents_bm25_dump_quantized.jsonl'
index_reader.dump_documents_BM25(dump_file_path)
index_reader.quantize_weights(dump_file_path, quantized_file_path)
```

Output in the .jsonl file for the quantized weight vectors is something like this:
```
{"id": "CACM-0001", "vector": {"22": 47, "perli": 104, "28": 55, "ca581203": 143, "languag": 39, "algebra": 71, "preliminari": 95, "3184": 57, "196": 82, "210": 69, "398": 72, "410": 74, "214": 98, "91": 104, "decemb": 41, "1958": 82, "1978": 2, "53": 77, "intern": 80, "cacm": 1, "samelson": 119, "1273": 98, "j": 26, "k": 52, "march": 12, "164": 102, "165": 113, "1": 70, "100": 87, "123": 64, "642": 77, "1883": 100, "1982": 81, "324": 96, "5": 1, "6": 31, "205": 70, "8": 43, "jb": 2, "report": 65, "669": 68, "pm": 7, "43": 74}}

# --- usage-interactive-search.md ---

# Pyserini: Guide to Interactive Searching

## How do I configure search?

Specifically, how do I configure BM25 parameters and use RM3 query expansion?

We're illustrating with `Robust04` because RM3 requires an index that stores document vectors (which MS MARCO passage does not).
Here's the basic usage of `SimpleSearcher`:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')
hits = searcher.search('hubble space telescope')

# Print the first 10 hits:
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:15} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 LA071090-0047   16.85690
 2 FT934-5418      16.75630
 3 FT921-7107      16.68290
 4 LA052890-0021   16.37390
 5 LA070990-0052   16.36460
 6 LA062990-0180   16.19260
 7 LA070890-0154   16.15610
 8 FT934-2516      16.08950
 9 LA041090-0148   16.08810
10 FT944-128       16.01920
```

Here's how to configure BM25 parameters and use RM3 query expansion:

```python
searcher.set_bm25(0.9, 0.4)
searcher.set_rm3(10, 10, 0.5)

hits2 = searcher.search('hubble space telescope')

# Print the first 10 hits:
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits2[i].docid:15} {hits2[i].score:.5f}')
```

Note that the results are different!


## How do I manually download indexes?

Pyserini comes with many pre-built indexes.
Here's how to use the one for `Robust04`:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')
```

More generally, `LuceneSearcher` can be initialized with a location to an index.
For example, you can download the same pre-built index as above by hand:

```bash
wget https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/anserini-indexes/raw/master/index-robust04-20191213.tar.gz
tar xvfz index-robust04-20191213.tar.gz -C indexes
rm index-robust04-20191213.tar.gz
```

And initialize `LuceneSearcher` as follows:

```python
searcher = LuceneSearcher('indexes/index-robust04-20191213/')
```

The result will be exactly the same.
The following method will list available pre-built indexes:

```
LuceneSearcher.list_prebuilt_indexes()
```

A description of what's available can be found [here](prebuilt-indexes.md).

## How do I manually remove indexes?

A common issue is recovering from partial downloads, for example, if you abort the downloading of a large index tarball.
In the standard flow, Pyserini downloads the tarball from UWaterloo servers, verifies the checksum, and then unpacks the tarball.
If this process is interrupted, you'll end up in an inconsistent state.

To recover, go to the default path for indexes `~/.cache/pyserini/indexes/`. If you've configured this directory, you'll need to go to your custom directory that was set. Remove any directories associated with the index you want to remove, and remove any tarballs (i.e., `.tar.gz` files), and re-run your command again.

# Pyserini: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

The Pyserini MCP server provides search and document retrieval capabilities through the Model Context Protocol, enabling AI assistants and other MCP clients to access Pyserini's information retrieval features.

This guide features Claude Desktop and Cursor as clients for our MCP server, but there exists many other clients that could work as well. 

## Local Server

To use the Pyserini MCP server locally with Claude Desktop, go to "Claude" -> "Settings" -> "Developer" and click edit config.
This takes you to the Claude config file `claude_desktop_config.json`, where you can add the Pyserini MCP server configuration under the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpyserini": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "pyserini.server.mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.
You should be able to see `mcpyserini` as an available tool in Claude.
To use mcpyserini, simply prompt Claude to use mcpyserini with a specific index and query.

If you run into Java version issues, one possible solution is to explicitly specify `JAVA_HOME`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpyserini": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "pyserini.server.mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "JAVA_HOME": "/path/to/your/conda/env/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For more details on configuring Claude Desktop, refer to the [Claude Desktop documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).


## Remote Server

To use the Pyserini MCP server remotely, first start the server on your remote machine:

```bash
python -m pyserini.server.mcp --transport streamable-http
```

Run the following on your local machine to forward the port from your remote machine:

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 username@hostname
```

To use it with Cursor, create `mcp.json` with the following and place it in your `.cursor` directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpyserini": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For more details on configuring Cursor with MCP, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol). 

As of time of writing (July 2025), Claude Desktop does not natively support remote MCP servers with the free plan. 
However, it is probably a more conventional client than Cursor, so we include the following 'hack' for using Claude Desktop with a remote MCP server.

<details>
<summary>Claude Desktop with remote MCP server hack</summary>
<br/>

Start the MCP server on your remote machine with the same instructions as above.

Download our bridging script on your local machine with the following command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castorini/pyserini/refs/heads/master/pyserini/server/mcp/pyserini_bridge.py -O pyserini_bridge.py
```

Modify your Claude Desktop configuration file `claude_desktop_config.json` with the following to point to the script you just downloaded: 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_pyserini": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "path/to/your/pyserini_bridge.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and you should be good to go.

# Pyserini: Direct Interaction via Pyjnius

For parts of Anserini that have not yet been integrated into the Pyserini interface, you can interact with Anserini's Java classes directly via [pyjnius](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius). 
First, call Pyserini's setup helper for setting up classpath for the JVM:

```python
from pyserini.setup import configure_classpath
configure_classpath('pyserini/resources/jars')
```

Now `autoclass` can be used to provide direct access to Java classes:

```python
from jnius import autoclass

JIndexReaderUtils = autoclass('io.anserini.index.IndexReaderUtils')
reader = JIndexReaderUtils.getReader('indexes/index-robust04-20191213/')

# Fetch raw document contents by id:
rawdoc = JIndexReaderUtils.documentRaw(reader, 'FT934-5418')
```


# --- usage-querybuilder.md ---

# Pyserini: Usage of the Query Builder API

The `querybuilder` provides functionality to construct Lucene queries through Pyserini.
These queries can be directly issued through the `LuceneSearcher`.
Instead of issuing the query `hubble space telescope` directly, we can also construct the same exact query manually as follows:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import querybuilder

# First, create term queries for each individual query term:
term1 = querybuilder.get_term_query('hubble')
term2 = querybuilder.get_term_query('space')
term3 = querybuilder.get_term_query('telescope')

# Then, assemble into a "bag of words" query:
should = querybuilder.JBooleanClauseOccur['should'].value

boolean_query_builder = querybuilder.get_boolean_query_builder()
boolean_query_builder.add(term1, should)
boolean_query_builder.add(term2, should)
boolean_query_builder.add(term3, should)

query = boolean_query_builder.build()
```

Then issue the query:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('robust04')

# Generate your query, per above...

hits = searcher.search(query)

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:15} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

The results should be exactly the same as:

```python
hits = searcher.search('hubble space telescope')
```

By manually constructing queries, it is possible to define the boost for each query term individually.
For example:

```python
boost1 = querybuilder.get_boost_query(term1, 2.)
boost2 = querybuilder.get_boost_query(term2, 1.)
boost3 = querybuilder.get_boost_query(term3, 1.)

should = querybuilder.JBooleanClauseOccur['should'].value

boolean_query_builder = querybuilder.get_boolean_query_builder()
boolean_query_builder.add(boost1, should)
boolean_query_builder.add(boost2, should)
boolean_query_builder.add(boost3, should)

query = boolean_query_builder.build()

hits = searcher.search(query)

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:15} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

Note that the results are different, because we've placed more weight on the term `hubble`.


# --- usage-rest.md ---

# Pyserini: REST API Server with FastAPI

The Pyserini FastAPI server provides a RESTful HTTP interface to Pyserini's search capabilities. 

## Starting the Server

You can start the FastAPI server by running the command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.server.rest
```

The server will start on [`http://localhost:8081/`](http://localhost:8081/) by default. You can specify a different port using the `--port` argument:

```bash
python -m pyserini.server.rest --port 8080
```

### Interactive API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation with Swagger UI at `/docs`. 
For example, if you're running the rest server on port 8081, then go to [`http://localhost:8081/docs`](http://localhost:8081/docs).

## API Endpoints

The FastAPI server provides several endpoints for interacting with Pyserini indexes, some of which are shown below:

### 1. Search Index

**Endpoint:** `GET v1/indexes/{index}/search`

Perform a search query on the specified index.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8081/v1/indexes/msmarco-v1-passage/search?query=what%20is%20a%20lobster%20roll&hits=1"
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "query": {
    "qid": "",
    "text": "what is a lobster roll"
  },
  "candidates": [
    {
      "docid": "7157707",
      "score": 11.0082998275757,
      "doc": "Cookbook: Lobster roll Media: Lobster roll A lobster-salad style roll from The Lobster Roll in Amagansett, New York on the Eastern End of Long Island A lobster roll is a fast-food sandwich native to New England made of lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog-style bun with the opening on the top rather than the side. The filling may also contain butter, lemon juice, salt and black pepper, with variants made in other parts of New England replacing the butter with mayonnaise. Others contain diced celery or scallion. Potato chips or french fries are the typical sides."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Get Document

**Endpoint:** `GET v1/indexes/{index}/documents/{docid}`

Retrieve a specific document by its document ID.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8081/v1/indexes/msmarco-v1-passage/documents/7157715"
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "7157715",
  "contents": "A Lobster Roll is a bread roll filled with bite-sized chunks of lobster meat. Lobster Rolls are made on the Atlantic coast of North America, from the New England area of the United States on up into the Maritimes areas of Canada."
}
```

For all endpoints see the Swagger UI documentation.

# Pyserini: Searching with Different Retrieval Models

Pyserini supports the following classes of retrieval models:

+ [Traditional lexical models](#traditional-lexical-models) (e.g., BM25) using Lucene.
+ [Learned sparse retrieval models](#learned-sparse-retrieval-models) (e.g., uniCOIL, SPLADE, etc.) using using Lucene.
+ [Learned dense retrieval models](#learned-dense-retrieval-models) (e.g., DPR, Contriever, etc.) using Lucene or Faiss.
+ [Hybrid retrieval models](#hybrid-retrieval-models) (e.g., dense-sparse fusion).

For many common IR and NLP corpora, we have already built indexes for you, so you can search them directly.
This guide describes using these indexes.

## Traditional Lexical Models

The `LuceneSearcher` class provides the entry point for sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25).
Pyserini supports a number of prebuilt indexes for common collections that it'll automatically download for you and store in `~/.cache/pyserini/indexes/`.

Here's how to use a prebuilt index for the [MS MARCO passage ranking task](http://www.msmarco.org/) and issue a query interactively (with BM25 ranking):

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher

lucene_bm25_searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-v1-passage')
hits = lucene_bm25_searcher.search('what is a lobster roll?')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieval results</summary>

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 7157707 11.00830
 2 6034357 10.94310
 3 5837606 10.81740
 4 7157715 10.59820
 5 6034350 10.48360
 6 2900045 10.31190
 7 7157713 10.12300
 8 1584344 10.05290
 9 533614  9.96350
10 6234461 9.92200
```

</details>

The `hits` object is an array of `io.anserini.search.ScoredDoc` objects, defined [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/src/main/java/io/anserini/search/ScoredDoc.java).
Thus, the accessible fields of a hit are:

```python
# The docid from the collection, type string.
hits[0].docid
# Lucene's internal docid, type int.
hits[0].lucene_docid
# Score, type float
hits[0].score
# Raw Lucene document, type org.apache.lucene.document.Document
hits[0].lucene_document
```

You can examine the actual text of the first hit, as follows:

```python
hits[0].lucene_document.get('raw')
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieved document</summary>

You'll get the complete JSON document, and inside you'll find the following passage text:

> Cookbook: Lobster roll Media: Lobster roll A lobster-salad style roll from The Lobster Roll in Amagansett, New York on the Eastern End of Long Island A lobster roll is a fast-food sandwich native to New England made of lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog-style bun with the opening on the top rather than the side. The filling may also contain butter, lemon juice, salt and black pepper, with variants made in other parts of New England replacing the butter with mayonnaise. Others contain diced celery or scallion. Potato chips or french fries are the typical sides.

</details>

See [this page](usage-fetch.md) for additional information on accessing documents from the index.

Prebuilt indexes are hosted on University of Waterloo servers.
The following method will list available prebuilt indexes:

```python
LuceneSearcher.list_prebuilt_indexes()
```

A description of what's available can be found [here](prebuilt-indexes.md).
Alternatively, see [this answer](usage-interactive-search.md#how-do-i-manually-download-indexes) for how to download an index manually.

## Learned Sparse Retrieval Models

The `LuceneImpactSearcher` class provides the entry point for retrieval using learned sparse models, which has an API that parallels `LuceneSearcher`.
Here, we are using the SPLADE++ EnsembleDistil model, with PyTorch query inference.

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneImpactSearcher

lucene_impact_searcher = LuceneImpactSearcher.from_prebuilt_index(
    'msmarco-v1-passage.splade-pp-ed',
    'naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil')
hits = lucene_impact_searcher.search('what is a lobster roll?')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieval results</summary>

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 7157710 155163.00000
 2 7157715 151475.00000
 3 7157707 142734.00000
 4 6321969 136473.00000
 5 6034350 129062.00000
 6 5515474 126583.00000
 7 6034353 115402.00000
 8 6321974 114477.00000
 9 5037023 113925.00000
10 1450828 111536.00000
```

</details>

The index does not store the original passages, so let's use the `lucene_bm25_searcher` to fetch the actual text:

```python
lucene_bm25_searcher.doc(hits[0].docid).raw()
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieved document</summary>

You'll get the complete JSON document, and inside you'll find the following passage text:

> Lobster roll. A lobster roll is a fast-food sandwich native to New England comprised of lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog-style bun with the opening on the top rather than the side. The filling may also contain butter, lemon juice, salt and black pepper, with variants made in other parts of New England replacing the butter with mayonnaise.

</details>

See [this page](usage-fetch.md) for additional information on accessing documents from the index.

## Learned Dense Retrieval Models

### Lucene

The `LuceneHnswDenseSearcher` class provides the entry point for dense retrieval using Lucene HNSW indexes, which has an API that parallels `LuceneSearcher`.
Here, we perform dense retrieval using BGE-base-en-v1.5 embeddings on the MS MARCO passage corpus, with ONNX query inference:

```python
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneHnswDenseSearcher

lucene_hnsw_searcher = LuceneHnswDenseSearcher.from_prebuilt_index(
    'msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.hnsw',
    ef_search=1000,
    encoder='BgeBaseEn15')
hits = lucene_hnsw_searcher.search('what is a lobster roll?', 10)

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieval results</summary>

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 7157710 0.92551
 2 7157715 0.92268
 3 7157707 0.89374
 4 6321969 0.89337
 5 6034350 0.87711
 6 7157708 0.86886
 7 7157713 0.85649
 8 7157711 0.85526
 9 6321974 0.85484
10 7157706 0.85433
```

</details>

The HNSW index does not store the original passages, so let's use the `lucene_bm25_searcher` to fetch the actual text:

```python
lucene_bm25_searcher.doc(hits[0].docid).raw()
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieved document</summary>

You'll get the complete JSON document, and inside you'll find the following passage text:

> Lobster roll. A lobster roll is a fast-food sandwich native to New England comprised of lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog-style bun with the opening on the top rather than the side. The filling may also contain butter, lemon juice, salt and black pepper, with variants made in other parts of New England replacing the butter with mayonnaise.

</details>

See [this page](usage-fetch.md) for additional information on accessing documents from the index.

### Faiss

The `FaissSearcher` class provides the entry point for dense retrieval, and its usage is quite similar to the examples above.
Note that you'll need to have `faiss` installed (as part of the optional dependencies).

Here, we perform dense retrieval using the TCT_ColBERT-V2-HN+ embeddings on the MS MARCO passage corpus, with PyTorch query inference:

```python
from pyserini.encode import TctColBertQueryEncoder
from pyserini.search.faiss import FaissSearcher

encoder = TctColBertQueryEncoder('castorini/tct_colbert-v2-hnp-msmarco')
faiss_searcher = FaissSearcher.from_prebuilt_index(
    'msmarco-v1-passage.tct_colbert-v2-hnp',
    encoder)
hits = faiss_searcher.search('what is a lobster roll')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieval results</summary>

The results should be as follows:

```
 1 7157715 80.14327
 2 7157710 80.09985
 3 7157707 79.70108
 4 6321969 79.37906
 5 6034350 79.14087
 6 7157708 79.08399
 7 4112862 79.03954
 8 7157713 78.71204
 9 4112861 78.67692
10 5515474 78.54551
```

</details>

The Faiss index does not store the original passages, so let's use the `lucene_bm25_searcher` to fetch the actual text:

```python
lucene_bm25_searcher.doc(hits[0].docid).raw()
```

<details>
<summary>Retrieved document</summary>

You'll get the complete JSON document, and inside you'll find the following passage text:

> A Lobster Roll is a bread roll filled with bite-sized chunks of lobster meat. Lobster Rolls are made on the Atlantic coast of North America, from the New England area of the United States on up into the Maritimes areas of Canada.

</details>

See [this page](usage-fetch.md) for additional information on accessing documents from the index.

## Hybrid Retrieval Models

The `HybridSearcher` class provides the entry point to perform hybrid sparse-dense retrieval.
The `HybridSearcher` class is constructed from combining the output of `LuceneSearcher` and `FaissSearcher`:

```python
from pyserini.encode import TctColBertQueryEncoder
from pyserini.search.lucene import LuceneSearcher
from pyserini.search.faiss import FaissSearcher
from pyserini.search.hybrid import HybridSearcher

sparse_searcher = LuceneSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-v1-passage')
encoder = TctColBertQueryEncoder('castorini/tct_colbert-msmarco')
dense_searcher = FaissSearcher.from_prebuilt_index(
    'msmarco-v1-passage.tct_colbert-v2-hnp',
    encoder)
hybrid_searcher = HybridSearcher(dense_searcher, sparse_searcher)
hits = hybrid_searcher.search('what is a lobster roll')

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {hits[i].docid:7} {hits[i].score:.5f}')
```

The results should be as follows:

<details>
<summary>Retrieval results</summary>

```
 1 7157715 73.84205
 2 7157710 73.70962
 3 7157707 73.47043
 4 6034350 73.07908
 5 6321969 72.89363
 6 2920399 72.83880
 7 6034357 72.72753
 8 5837606 72.71496
 9 7157708 72.68660
10 2900045 72.66441
```

</details>

In general, hybrid retrieval will be more effective than dense retrieval, which will be more effective than sparse retrieval.

# Indexing the ACL Anthology with Anserini

Anserini provides code for indexing the ACL anthology. Here we will use Pyserini (Python toolkit for Anserini) to do the indexing task.

## Generating ACL Anthology Data

**IMPORTANT:** The ACL Anthology requires Python 3.7+; no, it won't work with Python 3.6.

First, clone the ACL anthology repository containing the raw XML data:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:acl-org/acl-anthology.git
```

Next, create a conda environment, and activate it:

```bash
conda create -n pyserini_acl python=3.8
conda activate pyserini_acl
```

Next, navigate to the `acl-anthology` folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd acl-anthology
pip install -r bin/requirements.txt
```

Generate cleaned YAML data:

1. Add the following lines to `bin/create_hugo_yaml.py` before function `export_anthology`
```python
# Prevent yaml from creating aliases which can't be parsed by anserini
Dumper.ignore_aliases = lambda self, data: True
```

2. Execute the following script:
```bash
python bin/create_hugo_yaml.py
```

Generated ACL files can now be found in `acl-anthology/build/data/`

## Indexing Data

Now we should install Pyserini. You can follow the installation [here](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md). After you did the `Preliminaries` section, make sure to skip the `Pip Installation` and follow the `Development Installation`. 
Note that you should be using the already created `pyserini_acl` conda environment rather than making a new one that was instructed [here](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#:~:text=conda%20create%20%2Dn%20pyserini%20python%3D3.8). 
Just the `Development Installation` will give us the latest features we want.

Once you completely installed Pyserini, navigate to `acl-anthology` folder and run this line of code.

```
python -m pyserini.index -collection AclAnthology -generator AclAnthologyGenerator -threads 8 -input build/data/ -index index/lucene-index-acl-paragraph -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeContents -storeRaw -optimize
```
You can find the output files in the `index/lucene-index-acl-paragraph` directory.

## Reproduction Log[*](reproducibility.md)

+ Results reproduced by [@billcui57](https://github.com/billcui57) on 2023-06-04 (commit [9fe7836](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/commit/9fe78365eea89bc93c3a819b7be567d3e1a791eb))


# --- working-with-cord19.md ---

# Pyserini: Working with the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset

This page describes how to use Pyserini's Collection API to work with the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) from the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/).
This API provides access to the raw collection, independent of search.
If you want to actually search the collection, consult [this guide](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-cord19.md).

## Data Prep

The latest distribution available is from 2020/05/26.
First, download the data:

```bash
DATE=2020-05-26
DATA_DIR=./collections/cord19-"${DATE}"
mkdir "${DATA_DIR}"

wget https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/"${DATE}"/document_parses.tar.gz -P "${DATA_DIR}"
wget https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/"${DATE}"/metadata.csv -P "${DATA_DIR}"

ls "${DATA_DIR}"/document_parses.tar.gz | xargs -I {} tar -zxvf {} -C "${DATA_DIR}"
rm "${DATA_DIR}"/document_parses.tar.gz
```

## Collection Access

The following snippet of code allows you to iterate through all articles in the collection (note that although we use the `Cord19AbstractCollection`, `raw` _does_ provide access to the full text:

```python
from pyserini.collection import Collection,Cord19Article

collection = Collection('Cord19AbstractCollection', 'collections/cord19-2020-05-26')

cnt = 0;
full_text = {True : 0, False: 0}

articles = collection.__next__()
for (i, d) in enumerate(articles):
    article = Cord19Article(d.raw)
    cnt = cnt + 1
    full_text[article.is_full_text()] += 1
    if cnt % 1000 == 0:
        print(f'{cnt} articles read...')
```

The above snippet of code tallies the number of full-text articles in the collection.

CORD-19 comes in two parts, `metadata.csv` and the actual full-text JSON (if available).
What this code gives you is a JSON that has both integrated, along with a bunch of convenience methods.
For full-text articles, i.e., `is_full_text()` returns `True`, the metadata are provided with the `metadata()` method.
For articles without full text, only the metadata are available.

Let's examine the first full-text article in the collection:

```python
from pyserini.collection import Collection

# All this snippet of code does is to advance to the frist full-text article:
collection = Collection('Cord19AbstractCollection', 'collections/cord19-2020-05-26')

articles = collection.__next__()
article = None
for (i, d) in enumerate(articles):
    article = Cord19Article(d.raw)
    if article.is_full_text():
       break

# Now article contains the first full-text article.

# Let's print basic information:
print(f'cord_uid {article.cord_uid()}, full-text? {article.is_full_text()}')
print(f'title: {article.title()}')
print(f'abstract: {article.abstract()}')

# We can fetch the matadata:
metadata = article.metadata()

# For example, the DOI:
print(f'DOI: {metadata["doi"]}')

# The body() method returns an array of str corresponding to the full text.
print(f'The full text contains {len(article.body())} paragraphs')

# If you really want to manipulate the raw JSON:
article.json
```

For an article that does not contain full text, all the above methods behave the same way, except that `body()` returns an empty array.


## Load Data Into Neo4j

The easiest way to get started with Neo4j and start an instance is to [download the Neo4j desktop](https://neo4j.com/download-center/).

In the desktop app create a new project and add a database (create local graph). Give it any name and password and use Neo4j version `4.0.4`. The click "start" to start running database locally.

Once you have the [Pyserini development environment](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini#development-installation) setup run the `extract_citation_graph.py` script. For example:
```
python scripts/cord19/extract_citation_graph.py --path path/to/cord19
```

Due to security reasons Neo4j only allows Cypher queries to acess files in certain directories. Move the generated csv files, `edges.csv` to the import directory of Neo4j. Follow [this guide](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/file-locations/) to find the import directory on your machine.


To load the csv files into Neo4j run the following Cypher queries in the Neo4j Browser.

Create a unique constraint on `cord_uid` to improve lookup time:
```
CREATE CONSTRAINT cord_uid ON (n:PUBLICATION) ASSERT n.CordUID IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT pmcid ON (n:PUBLICATION) ASSERT n.PMCID IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT title ON (n:PUBLICATION) ASSERT n.Title IS UNIQUE;
```

Create article nodes for full-text papers in CORD-19. Try to merge on paper_id. If the article is from PMC the paper_id is a pmcid, otherwise it is a hash.
```
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///articles.csv' AS row
MERGE (a:PUBLICATION {PMCID:row.pmcid})
SET a.CordUID = row.cord_uid, a.Title = left(row.title, 500)
```

Create nodes for all the cited articles.
```
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///edges.csv' AS row
MERGE (cited:PUBLICATION {Title:row.target_title})
WITH row, cited WHERE cited.DOI IS NULL AND row.doi IS NOT NULL
SET cited.DOI = row.doi;
```

Create citations for cited papers.
```
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///edges.csv' AS row
MATCH (article:PUBLICATION {CordUID:row.cord_uid})
MATCH (cited:PUBLICATION {Title:row.target_title})
CREATE (article)-[r:BIB_REF]->(cited)
```

Run a test query, return the top 10 cited articles:
```
MATCH (a)<-[r:BIB_REF]-(b) WITH a, count(r) as num_cites RETURN a ORDER BY num_cites DESC LIMIT 10
```
## Stream Into Gephi

Install Gephi from [this link](https://gephi.org/users/install/) and create a new project.

Install APOC in Neo4j and Graph Streaming in Gephi. In Gephi, right click on `Master Server` and select `Start` 

Stream into Gephi.
```
MATCH (a)<-[r:BIB_REF]-(b) WITH a, count(r) as num_cites
WITH a ORDER BY num_cites DESC LIMIT 10
MATCH path = ()-->(a)
call apoc.gephi.add(null,'workspace1', path, 'weightproperty', ['CordUID','Title','DOI']) yield nodes, relationships
return nodes, relationships
```
From the Layout panel in Gephi, choose `ForceAtlas 2` algorithm and tune the `scaling` parameter for a better graph spatialization.

You should get the following visualization:

# Pyserini: Working with Entity Linking

In this page, we introduce an entity linking [script](../scripts/entity_linking.py) which links texts to both Wikipedia and Wikidata entities, using [Radboud Entity Linker (REL)](https://github.com/informagi/REL#rel-radboud-entity-linker) and [spaCy NER](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities).
The input should be a JSONL file which has one json object per line, like [this](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/integrations/resources/sample_collection_jsonl/documents.jsonl), while the output is also a JSONL file, where each json object is of format:

```
{
  "id": ...,
  "contents": ...,
  "entities": [
    {"start_pos": ..., "end_pos": ..., "ent_text": ..., "wikipedia_id": ..., "wikidata_id": ..., "ent_type": ...},
    ...
  ]
}
```

For example, given the input file

```json
{"id": "doc1", "contents": "The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science."}
```

, the output file would be

```json
{
  "id": "doc1",
  "contents": "The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science.",
  "entities": [
    {"start_pos": 0, "end_pos": 21, "ent_text": "The Manhattan Project", "wikipedia_id": "Manhattan_Project", "wikidata_id": "Q127050", "ent_type": "ORG"},
    {"start_pos": 65, "end_pos": 77, "ent_text": "World War II", "wikipedia_id": "World_War_II", "wikidata_id": "Q362", "ent_type": "EVENT"}
  ]
}
```

## Input Prep

Let us take MS MARCO passage dataset as an example.
We need to download the MS MARCO passage dataset and convert the tsv collection into jsonl files by following the detailed instruction [here](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md#data-prep).
Now we should have 9 jsonl files in `collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl`, and each file path can be considered as `input_path` in our scripts.

## REL

First, we follow the Github [instruction](https://github.com/informagi/REL#installation-from-source) to install REL and download required generic file, appropriate wikipedia corpus as well as the corresponding ED model.
Then we set up variable `base_url` as explained in this [tutorial](https://github.com/informagi/REL/blob/master/tutorials/01_How_to_get_started.md#how-to-get-started).

Note that the `base_url` and ED model path are required as `rel_base_url` and `rel_ed_model_path` in our script respectively.
Another parameter `rel_wiki_version` depends on the version of wikipedia corpus downloaded, e.g. `wiki_2019` for 2019 Wikipedia corpus.

## wikimapper

REL Entity Linker only links texts to Wikipedia entities, but we need their Wikidata information as well.
[Wikimapper](https://pypi.org/project/wikimapper/) is a Python library mapping Wikipedia titles to Wikidata IDs.
In order to use the mapping functionality, we have to download its precomputed indices [here](https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wikimapper/).
Note that the path storing precomputed indices is required as `wikimapper_index` in our script.

## Run Script

Finally, we are ready to run our entity linking script:

```bash
python entity_linking.py --input_path [input_jsonl_file] --rel_base_url [base_url] --rel_ed_model_path [ED_model] \
--rel_wiki_version [wikipedia_corpus_version] --wikimapper_index [precomputed_index] \
--spacy_model [en_core_web_sm, en_core_web_lg, etc.] --output_path [output_jsonl_file]
```

An extended example assuming you're running the script from the scripts dir:
```bash
REL_DATA_PATH=/home/$USER/REL/data
INPUT_JSONL_FILE=../collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl/docs00.json
mkdir ../collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl_with_entities/
OUTPUT_JSONL_FILE=../collections/msmarco-passage/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl_with_entities/docs00.json
BASE_URL=$REL_DATA_PATH
ED_MODEL=$REL_DATA_PATH/ed-wiki-2019/model
WIKI_VERSION=wiki_2019
WIKIMAPPER_INDEX=$REL_DATA_PATH/index_enwiki-20190420.db

python entity_linking.py --input_path $INPUT_JSONL_FILE \
--rel_base_url $BASE_URL --rel_ed_model_path $ED_MODEL \
--rel_wiki_version $WIKI_VERSION --wikimapper_index $WIKIMAPPER_INDEX \
--spacy_model en_core_web_sm --output_path $OUTPUT_JSONL_FILE
```

It should take about 5 to 10 minutes to run entity linking on 5,000 MS MARCO passages on Compute Canada.
See [this](https://github.com/castorini/onboarding/blob/master/docs/cc-guide.md#compute-canada) for instructions about running scripts on Compute Canada.

# Pyserini: Working with spaCy

This page describes how to take Pyserini output and apply [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to do some NLP basics on it.


## spaCy Prep

First, download the spaCy package and model:

```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

In this guide, we use model `en_core_web_sm`, which is a small English model trained on written web text (blogs, news, comments).
There are many other [models](https://spacy.io/usage/models) supporting different languages, you can download the best one for your application.


## Search

Use Pyserini's `SimpleSearcher` to fetch document from the MS MARCO pre-built index [`msmarco-passage`](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md):

```python
import json
from pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher

# Initialize a searcher from a pre-built index
searcher = SimpleSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('msmarco-passage')

# Fetch raw text of a document given its docid
raw = searcher.doc('1').raw()
# Get actual content from raw
content = json.loads(raw)['contents']
print(content)
```

`content` should be as follows:

```text
The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science.
```


## Linguistic Features

Load spaCy's pre-trained model to a `Language` object called `nlp`, then call the `nlp` on `content` to get a processed [`Doc`](https://spacy.io/api/doc) object:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc = nlp(content)
```

From `Doc`, we can apply spaCy's NLP [features](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101#features) on our document.
In this guide, we will talk about [Tokenization](#tokenization), [POS Tagging](#part-of-speech-pos-tagging), [NER](#named-entity-recognition-ner) and [Sentence Segmentation](#sentence-segmentation).


### Tokenization

Each `Doc` object contains individual [`Token`](https://spacy.io/api/token) objects, and you can iterate over them:

```python
for token in doc:
    print(token.text)
```

The result should be as follows:

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | ... |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| The | Manhattan | Project | and | its | atomic | bomb | helped | bring | an | end | to | World | War | II | . | ... |


### Part-of-speech (POS) Tagging

There are many linguistic annotations contained in `Token`'s [attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes), such as

TEXT: The original word text.

LEMMA: The base form of the word.

POS: The simple [UPOS](https://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/pos/) part-of-speech tag.

DEP: Syntactic dependency, i.e. the relation between tokens.

SHAPE: The word shape – capitalization, punctuation, digits.

STOP: Is the token part of a stop list, i.e. the most common words of the language?

These attributes can be easily accessed by:

```python
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.dep_, token.shape_, token.is_stop)
```

The output is shown in the following table:

| TEXT | LEMMA | POS | DEP | SHAPE | STOP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| The | the | DET | det | Xxx | True |
| Manhattan | Manhattan | PROPN | compound | Xxxxx | False |
| Project | Project | PROPN | nsubj | Xxxxx | False |
| and | and | CCONJ | cc | xxx | True |
| its | -PRON- | DET | poss | xxx | True |
| atomic | atomic | ADJ | amod | xxxx | False |
| bomb | bomb | NOUN | conj | xxxx | False |
| helped | help | VERB | aux | xxxx | False |
| bring | bring | VERB | ROOT | xxxx | False |
| an | an | DET | det | xx | True |
| end | end | NOUN | dobj | xxx | False |
| to | to | ADP | prep | xx | True |
| World | World | PROPN | compound | Xxxxx | False |
| War | War | PROPN | compound | Xxx | False |
| II | II | PROPN | pobj | XX | False |
| . | . | PUNCT | punct | . | False |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

spaCy can recognize various [types](https://spacy.io/api/annotation#named-entities) of named entities in a document:

```python
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.start_char, ent.end_char, ent.label_)
```

The following table shows recognized entities:

| TEXT | START | END | LABEL | DESCRIPTION |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The Manhattan Project | 0 | 21 | ORG | Companies, agencies, institutions, etc. |
| World War II | 65 | 77 | EVENT | Named hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc. |


### Sentence Segmentation

`Doc` also contains segmented sentences as [`Span`](https://spacy.io/api/span) objects, we can iterate over them:

```python
for sent in doc.sents:
    print(sent.text)
```

Then we have sentences:

| # | SENTENCE |
|---|---|
| 0 | The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. |
| 1 | Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science. |
